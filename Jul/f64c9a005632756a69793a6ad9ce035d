International Community abeg force help on us if u must oooo. (sic) “There is nothing shameful in going to your elder brothers in the global community and telling them, ‘please come and help me, I cannot help myself. There is nothing shameful about it. We know that we cannot protect and defend ourselves, so why don’t we go and look for help from other countries. “What is shameful there, if we go and meet America, Britain, anybody, or China, to come and help us. We cannot help ourselves. We cannot solve our insecurity problem. Yet, we are proud about it; you don’t do that. B humble. Go and tell them to help you because you need help.”
