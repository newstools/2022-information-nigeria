Peter Obi, presidential candidate of Labour Party (LP), has named Datti Baba-Ahmed, founder of Baze University, as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election. Obi unveiled his running mate at an event in Abuja on Friday. The development comes less than 24 hours after Doyin Okupe, former senior special assistant on public affairs to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, announced his withdrawal as the party’s vice-presidential candidate. The party had in June named Okupe as its “placeholder” vice-presidential candidate.

In his remarks, Baba-Ahmed said he is “humbled and appreciative” of his selection as the party’s vice-presidential candidate. According to him, the “fundamental reason” for being on “this ticket is to rescue Nigeria” from the state of collapse. “I cannot afford not to be part of the movement to rescue Nigeria,” he said.
