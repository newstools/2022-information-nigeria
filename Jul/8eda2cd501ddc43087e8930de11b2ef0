He said, “the numerous members of our party are ready and determined to vote for the candidate of our party during the governorship election that is coming up. “Our members want to see new Nigeria starting from this state. The logo of our party is well known which shows that Nigeria under this party will be united not minding religion, ethnicity or region of anybody in this country. Those who are yet to collect their PVCs should do so to vote for our party. “Failure to vote for our party that will bring positive change is allowing these people to continue to rule our state governments and national level. All of us know that these two major parties have failed us and have nothing more to offer. Let us vote them out and that will start from the this state.”
