Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior and former governor of Osun, did not vote at the governorship election on Saturday. Residents, who spoke to TheCable in Ifofin, Ilesha area, where Aregbesola was expected to cast his vote, said it is “unlike the minister” who always arrives in his hometown on the eve of an election. “By now, everywhere will be bubbling with activities because Aregbe would have entered since Friday,” a resident said.
