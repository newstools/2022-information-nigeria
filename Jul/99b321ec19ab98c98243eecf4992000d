Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has announced the appointment of 29 Liaison Officers for the 20 Local Government Areas of the state. The appointment came 24 hours after his colleague governor in Osun State, Gboyega Oyetola, lost his second term bid to the Peoples Democratic Party candidate and Governor-elect, Ademola Adeleke. Abiodun had come under intense attacks from members of the opposition parties who claimed the PDP’s victory in the Osun state governorship election held on Saturday was a signal of the impending loss of his second term. The appointment has been reported in some quarters of the state as a way to pacify some aggrieved party members who might work against his second term re-election.
