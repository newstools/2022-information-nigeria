We have always been very conscious of the need to achieve food security in Nigeria, and to encourage our local farmers and rural economies. “This is a country that was once dependent on foreign rice. Confident that we can grow and eat Nigerian rice, we closed the border to foreign rice, and also put policies in place to support local production. Today Nigerians are eating home-grown rice.”
