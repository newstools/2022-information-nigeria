 A resident of Lagos Island has mocked Nigerian singer David Adeleke popularly called Davido over the state of the road allegedly leading to his house. In the viral video, the man showed the deplorable state of the road within the area, stating that Davido and some other residents are unable to fix it. The man added that residents of Banana Island including Davido are not ashamed of the nature of the road. This sparked reactions online with some netizens defending Davido, saying he’s not the government responsible for fixing roads. ayrubber wrote: “In Nigeria you can’t just fix a federal or state road cos you have money!
