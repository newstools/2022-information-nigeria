Femi Fani-Kayode, a former minister of aviation, insisted on criticizing the military’s approach to the nation’s security issues. Fani-Kayode claimed in a statement on Sunday that the military high command could not silence him regarding the country’s deteriorating security situation. He asserted that the military cannot impose a culture of silence on Nigerians given the obvious failure of the military leadership to handle insecurity. Fani-Kayode stated that the military leadership has performed below expectations and that the truth needs to be aired. He claimed that he was responding to a recent press release by the Defence Headquarters.

Fani-Kayode added that if the military commanders know his antecedents as they claim, they will appreciate the fact that attempting to threaten or intimidate him into not pointing out and exposing their abysmal failures can never work.
