The National Examinations Council (NECO) has denied rescheduling any of its ongoing Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) for school-based candidates slated for Saturday, July 9. It stated that rather, it has given a whole examination free week, beginning from Friday, July 8 to Wednesday, July 13, 2022, to enable the Muslim faithful have enough time to celebrate the festival. This, according to NECO’s Head of Information and Public Relations Division, Mr. Azeez Sani in a statement in Minna, is contrary to insinuations in some quarters that the council has scheduled examination for 9th July, 2022, which is Sallah Day (Eid-Adha).
