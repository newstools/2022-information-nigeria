 Adamu Garba, a politician, has rejoined the All Progressives Congress (APC) after defecting to the Young Progressives Party (YPP). Garba left the ruling party to contest for the YPP presidential ticket but lost to Malik Ado-Ibrahim. When he obtained YPP’s presidential expression of interest and nomination form in May, Garba stated that the youth have no future in the APC and in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

But in a tweet on Tuesday, the politician stated that he is back in the ruling party, and that it would do harm to the country if he did not support Bola Tinubu, APC presidential candidate, and Kashim Shettima, his running mate. “Yes, I am fully back to APC. I could do more harm to my country, Nigeria if I did not support a combination of a great strategist and a great tactician on a single ticket,” he tweeted. “It is BAT/Hashim that should take over all polling units in Nigeria come 2023. RE-DECAMPED!”
