Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior and former governor of Osun, has reacted to the defeat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the governorship election in the state. On Sunday, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Ademola Adeleke, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, the winner of the Osun governorship election. The PDP candidate secured 403,371 votes to defeat Gboyega Oyetola, the incumbent governor and the candidate of the APC, who polled 375,027 votes. Adeleke won 17 LGAs to satisfy the requirements of the law to be the winner of the contest. Oyetola could only secure victory in 13 LGAs.
