Every time I felt I was going through an episode, I listened to music.” The billionaire’s son said music is a healthy form of escapism as it helps one bridge the gap between being conscious and subconscious self. Kiddwaya said popular American Rapper J. Cole was a major source of inspiration in his dark times. “I am a J.cole fan, he is one of my favourite artistes, he is the kinda guy that I go to for inspiration.” He added that his music catalogue expands beyond hip-hop adding that he shared equal love for other kinds of music such as rock, blues, house and techno.
