People try to play politics with everything. “Yes, I lost my WAEC certificate but I have the print out from Edo College, Benin City, which clearly stated that I have distinction in all subjects. “The Higher School Certificate was attached and it has been acknowledged by Edo College and the school put it out there that I made an ‘A’ `B’ `B’. “I do not pride myself but it was very difficult to make such grade in higher school at that time. “My high school result was the second best nationally in 1976 when I finished. So, many universities admitted me through Telegram as at that time and I had to start making choices of which to accept. “Of course, it’s very clear that I finished medical school at the University of Ibadan. I was 21years and some months; I was less than 22 years of age.’’
