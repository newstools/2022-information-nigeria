The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, has revealed that the commission has 334 pre-election cases in court to contend with. He, however, pointed out that though the cases were purely intra-party issues, the commission had been joined in all of them. Yakubu spoke yesterday in Abuja during the swearing in of a new Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) from Plateau State, Dr Hale Gabriel Longpet, who was later deployed to Kogi State. He also revealed that INEC would today publish the particulars of candidates nominated by political parties for governorship and state assembly elections in all the constituencies nationwide as required by law.

The commission will continue to engage with political parties while standing firm against any transgression by strictly enforcing the provisions of the law and extant regulations and guidelines.”
