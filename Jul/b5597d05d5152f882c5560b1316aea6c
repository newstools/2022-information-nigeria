 Nollywood actress Etinosa Idemudia has slammed her colleagues for recording and sharing videos of their condolence visit to late Ada Ameh’s friend, Empress Njamah. This is coming hours after a heartbreaking video of Empress crying uncontrollable surfaced online and Nigerian comedienne Real Warri Pikin also shared a video of her visit to Empress. Reacting to this, Etinosa in the post shared on Instagram, said people need to drop their phones and cameras and engage in the condolence visit they came for. Etinosa claimed that if people are really touched by the sad incident, they would not tell their P.A to record them and share such videos on social media for publicity sighting. “If you are really touched, if it is not just for a publicity sighting for you, you will not have mind telling your P.A hold the camera. As I’m walking in, be recording. Record everybody. She’s crying record her. Then you sat down, edited, and even put the soundtrack. No, it’s offensive. Clout is good business but this one is not nice.”
