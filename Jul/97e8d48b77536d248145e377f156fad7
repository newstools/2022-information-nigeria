The presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, Omoyele Sowore, has stated that his administration will probe past governments if elected into office in the 2023 presidential election. Sowore made this statement via his verified Twitter handle, @yeleSowore, on Saturday. Recall that the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, had said that if elected into office in the 2023 elections, his administration would not carry out a witch-hunt of previous governments. Obi stated this in an interview with journalists shortly after unveiling an educationist, Dr. Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, as his running mate on Friday.

He said, “As President of Nigeria, I will probe and retrieve every penny stolen by past Nigerian rulers, those who have murdered innocents and deprived them of a bright future. If we could be retrieving money from dead and buried Sanni Abacha, we should retrieve from living legendary thieves.” Retweeting Sowore’s tweet, Sowore’s running mate, Haruna Magashi, posted, “There will be no exemptions, all political thieves, past and present will be stripped under our administration. Stolen funds from Nigerians must be taken back.”
