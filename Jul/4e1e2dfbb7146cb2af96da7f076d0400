Atiku spoke in an interview on Arise TV on Friday. Speaking on the chances of the LP in the 2023 elections, the PDP presidential candidate stated that the LP will not divide the votes meant for the PDP as being suggested in some quarters.

What is the performance of the Labour Party? “This is a party that doesn’t have a governor, doesn’t have members of the national assembly, doesn’t have state assembly members, and politics in this country depends on the structures you have at the various levels — at the local government level, at the state level, and at the national level.”
