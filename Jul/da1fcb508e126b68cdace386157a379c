Borno State Senator and a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Ali Ndume, has expressed that President Muhammadu Buhari should directly address the nation on the matter of insecurity, rather than issuing statements through his media advisers. The Senator made the comment while responding to questions on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Thursday. “I’ve said it before,” Ndume said. “When it comes to issues like these, it is the President himself that is supposed to be talking to Nigerians, not some press adviser.

By the time you ask people to elect you as President, anything that happens to any Nigerian, God will hold you accountable you for it.” Ndume added that he was “really disappointed with the response of so many leaders. “And it is our responsibility – of government – the security and welfare of its citizens. And you have leaders responding as if it is a casualty, not their responsibility. “I feel pained to be called a Senator. I’m almost like helpless. Many of us are like that, sitting down as observers.”
