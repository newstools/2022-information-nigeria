  Recall that the ministry which was located at no 88B Bida Road, Fegge, Onitsha, and marked by the Anambra State government, was demolished on the 7th July. According to reports, the church building was sitting on a huge canal and obstructing waterways, prompting the government to order its removal as an illegal building in line with Governor Charles Soludo’s plan to demolish over 200 buildings in Onitsha blocking the drainage linking the River Niger. Odumeje, in the video that surfaced on social media, was seen being assaulted by government officials who later bundled him out of the church premises. Reacting to the development, Rita Edochie, via her Instagram, called out the state government for misplaced priorities. She then went further to slam people mocking the controversial prophet, saying that it could be their turn tomorrow. Read her post below; “HEY WERE SENT BY THE ANAMBRA STATE GOVERNOR TO BRING DOWN HIS CHURCH.
DID HE ALSO ASKED THEM TO BEAT THE LION HIMSELF ODUMEJEJE ? “ALL YOU START HEARING NOW IS 70 × 7 BUT WHEN YOU ARE DOING THE WRONG THING THAT YOU ARE PAID TO DO YOU WON’T REMEMBER 70 × 7. “I LAUGH BECAUSE THERE IS SERIOUS WAR NOW IN THE KINGDOM OF DARKNESS BECAUSE OF THIS ACT THAT GOD ALMIGHTY USED SOLUDO SENT MEN TO CREATE SO LET’S SEE.
