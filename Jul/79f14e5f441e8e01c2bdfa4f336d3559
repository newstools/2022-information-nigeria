He said, “A committee was set up by the party to decide where the presidential candidate of the party would come from. I was a member of that committee, which agreed that something was wrong (in terms of power rotation), but it is too late to do anything about it now; that next time, the party should stick to power rotation since it is written in its constitution.”
