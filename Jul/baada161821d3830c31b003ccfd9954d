The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has warned politicians to desist from linking it with their politics and selection process, insisting its members remained freedom fighters. The group particularly advised presidential candidate for New Nigerian People Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso to stop linking it with Peter Obi, his political ambition and campaign. This was contained in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary Emma Powerful. IPOB noted that Obi is not its member and never supported its freedom agitation.
