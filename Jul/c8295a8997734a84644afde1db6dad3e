First and foremost I would like to thank those who reached out concerning this issue, thank you so much. God bless everyone,” he wrote on Instagram.

Nobody is perfect and I will want to apologize openly to my fans, family and friends who felt disappointed in my write-up, I take back those words and I promise going forward I will do better.” Declaring his love for his children, he wrote, “I love my kids and I promise to do the needful henceforth. I am apologizing to the general public to please forgive my earlier outburst and disregard it, to my fans worldwide, God bless everyone and to those who reached out too, I appreciate it a lot.”
