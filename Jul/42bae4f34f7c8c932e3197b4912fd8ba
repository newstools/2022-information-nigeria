The president praised Jacobs’ brilliant capacity for interpreting roles, demystifying complex subjects, and making ideas understandable to both young and old audiences while eradicating cultural, racial, and religious boundaries to become a household figure throughout the nation and beyond. Buhari also believed that Jacobs’ innate ability to advise, motivate, and instruct others easily qualified him for the jobs and praised his vision of attracting many people to the industry and helping them achieve fame. He prayed that the Almighty God would grant him better health, longer life and steadfastness in service to the arts, God, and humanity.
