A group, the Nigeria Democracy Defence Watch, has appealed to the All Progressives Congress and its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, against presenting a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the 2023 presidential election. The group made the appeal in a letter to President Muhammadu Buhari, titled: “APC’s Muslim-Muslim Ticket in Nigeria’s 2023 Elections: A Threat to National Stability, Regional Peace and Security.” The letter, signed by the group’s National Coordinator​​​​​ and National Secretary, Alhaji Ahmed Adamu, and Otunba Adeniji Adegoke, respectively, was made available to newsmen in Abuja on Monday. The letter, according to the group, was copied to all heads of democratic and security institutions as well as other international bodies. The group stated that a Muslim-Muslim ticket would not only be a threat to national stability but could also retard the country’s peace and security.

This, it said, would ultimately be resisted by the country’s millions of practicing Christians, moderate and progressive Muslims, and civic groups. It added that ethnocultural associations and enlightened members of the international communities could also protest such a ticket. We are therefore calling on President Buhari to direct the security forces to do the needful by advising Bola Tinubu, the APC presidential candidate and the party on the possible threats this action could pose to security in the country. “It is pertinent to note the serious implications of the action with regards to security, especially when one rightly imagines that Christians will feel threatened with a Muslim-Muslim ticket. “They may resort to pulpit preaching and mobilisation of opinions across the Christendom,” the group said.
