Peter Obi, presidential candidate of Labour Party (LP), has responded to a comment by Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in which the latter criticised the LP. At the APC governorship rally in Osun on Tuesday, Tinubu had described the LP as “a mushroom party”. “Think about your children and vote accordingly so you can see the future. Come out en masse. Don’t mind PDP and other mushroom parties — parties like Labour; they will labour till they die. God will not make you labourers,” he had said. Speaking on Wednesday at a rally organised by the LP in Osun, Obi stated that such a comment by the APC presidential candidate comes from a place of hatred, but the LP will respond with love. “I listened to our national chairman when he said that somebody said that they can labour till death. When they they talk like that, when they show you hatred, Labour Party will show them love. There is dignity in labour,” he said.
