The All Progressives Congress (APC) has expressed that Ahmad Usman El-Marzuq, its national legal adviser, did not resign his membership over the Muslim-Muslim ticket choice of the party. In a statement on Monday, Felix Morka, the APC’s spokesman, denied reports in several news outlets that Daniel Bwala, a legal assistant to Ovie Omo-Agege, the deputy president of the senate, is the party’s legal adviser.
