The Labour Party’s (LP) presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has urged his followers to be accepting of opposing views. On Sunday, he made the appeal using his verified Twitter account. A few days prior, Obi supporters criticized Poju Oyemade, senior pastor of Covenant Christian Centre, vehemently for his social media post. Oyemade had cautioned young people not to invest their energy in “poorly planned projects.” Although the clergyman avoided mentioning any names, his counsel was interpreted as a criticism of the Obi youth movement.

In expressing ourselves, we should do so with grace so as not to precipitately shut doors to future collaborations on sustainable nation-building.”
