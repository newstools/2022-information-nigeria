Abdullahi Adamu, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has stated that his party does not want to lose any member but it cannot force anyone to stay. Speaking with journalists on Saturday after visiting Abdullahi Mohammed, governor of Nasarawa, at the government house in Lafia, Adamu said it is a “season for defection” in the country’s political space. The national chairman stated that politicians are adults who are capable of making their own decisions.
