Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed has condemned the call by five US senators for the re-designation of Nigeria as a country of particular concern over alleged violation of religious freedom. In June, the five US senators asked Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, to re-designate Nigeria as a country of particular concern. They cited the attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo state, and the lynching of Deborah Samuel, a female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, as cases of “religious persecutions” in Nigeria. But responding to the allegation in an interview with NAN on Monday, the minister of information, stated that the call was based on “false premise and misunderstanding of what is going on in the country”.
