Life itself is scary and unpredictable. Are we going to stop living because of that? Your career has it’s ups and downs, will you quit acting because of that? Don’t lose a beautiful experience because of news you read. There are several Happy marriages, they just don’t make it to the news and when they even do, we seem to be used to sad stories that we consider them liars. The only reason you should return your is if the man in your life is not worth the journey. Take some time of the media and reevaluate. All the best” nwa_oma82 wrote: “Everyone has their destination when it’s comes to marriage yours is destined to work believe that and proceed mami”
