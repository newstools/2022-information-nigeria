Anambra Governor Charles Chukwuma Soludo has explained why the demolition of the Mountain of Holy Ghost Intervention and Deliverance Ministry owned by controversial Prophet Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere, a.k.a ‘Odumeje’ in the commercial city of Onitsha took place. Soludo, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Christian Aburime, stated that the cleric failed to comply with government’s directive to remove illegal structure he built on the waterway. He revealed that Odumeje’s church in March this year was identified by the government as one of the buildings sitting on drainage channels, and marked for demolition, in line with Onitsha Urban Renewal Plan spearheaded by his administration.
