Reno Omokri, a socio-political activist, has declared that Bola Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate is not a threat to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Omokri said the only threat to PDP’s victory in 2023 is Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, and not Tinubu.

Tinubu is going nowhere. A KNOWN DRUG LORD who can’t win his home state can’t win the whole slate. “As for the other deluded fellow, in 8 months’ time, he will wake up from his dream and realise it was a nightmare!,” he tweeted.
