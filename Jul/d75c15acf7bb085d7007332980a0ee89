The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) says Abba Kyari, suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, is still in custody. Kyari, who is currently under investigation for alleged drug trafficking, had been sent to Kuje prison. There have been concerns about Kyari’s whereabouts since the prison where he is being kept was invaded on Tuesday night. Recall that it was reported that gunmen broke into the facility and released some of the inmates, including Boko Haram suspects and bandits.
