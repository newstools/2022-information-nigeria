Rotimi Akeredolu, the governor of Ondo State and Chairman of the Southern Governors’ Forum, has condemned the bandits’ attack on President Muhammadu Buhari’s convoy on Tuesday in Katsina State. He stated that the country’s security situation has worsened at an alarming rate, while calling the act by the bandits as daring. The governor made this statement when hosting some of his former classmates from the Loyola College, Ibadan class of 1968–1972 in his office in Alagbaka, Akure, the state capital. Akeredolu emphasized that his colleagues’ desire for the State Police is not an attempt at self-aggrandizement but rather a response to the current state of the nation’s security, which he described as having gotten worse rather than better.

It is a reality of the time. For us in the South and even in the North, I know so many of them that have come to accept that a single command of Police is not good for this country. This country is too big. “We will continue to make our voice heard everywhere. We are almost there. We are licking our wounds here over the June 5 attack in Owo. It is a serious wound.”
