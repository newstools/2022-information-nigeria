 Former Big Brother Naija housemate, Ka3na has been called out by a male tattoo artist who accused her of paying him “peanuts”. The tattoo artist lamented over being underpaid after doing a good job in drawing a tattoo to cover up her scars from surgery.  “I don’t know who this Ka3na is and I do not care but I just want her to properly pay me for my services. You cannot pay your doctors millions to enhance your body through surgery and then pay me peanuts to do a good job of covering the scars left after surgery using tattoos. “Most of the women who need my services after their surgeries behave the same way Ka3na does”.
