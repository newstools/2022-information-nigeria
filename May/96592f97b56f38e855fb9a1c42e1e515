The Coalition for Peter Obi has urged the former Anambra governor to run for president in another political party. Obi is one of the presidential hopefuls of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In a statement issued on Tuesday, coalition spokesman Zubairu Mohammad said that some PDP officials have banded together to derail Obi’s presidential ambitions. According to Mohammed, the opposing party encourages politicians with “no verified sources of income to fling money around.” “Recent developments within the leadership of PDP is very pathetic as many chieftains of the party have ganged up to frustrate the presidential ambition of genuine and decent presidential aspirants, thereby encouraging unscrupulous politicians with no verifiable sources of income to throw money around,” the spokesman said.
