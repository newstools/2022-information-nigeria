Governor Aminu Tambuwal, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential hopeful, has promised to extend the South-West Regional Security Network, popularly known as Amotekun, if elected in 2023. Tambuwal claimed he will strengthen the country as part of his restructuring plans in separate talks with PDP delegates in Osun and Ogun states. Tambuwal stated at the PDP secretariat in Osogbo, the capital of Osun State, that insecurity is a serious concern and that bolstering the South-West Security Network for good policing and probable adoption as state police is a vital component of his agenda.

I present my fact, you present yours and we find a common ground to achieve it. Devolution of power to states is a must if we must progress in Nigeria.”
