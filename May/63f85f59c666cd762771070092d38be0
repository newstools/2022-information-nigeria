 Legendary Nigerian music executive and producer Don Jazzy has felicitated his company, Mavin Records, on its one-decade anniversary. 10 years ago, Don Jazzy activated Mavin Records, also known as the Supreme Mavin Dynasty, after discontinuing Mo’Hits Records, which he co-owned with veteran singer D’Banj. The label is still home to recording artists such as Korede Bello, Dr. SID, D’Prince, Di’Ja, Johnny Drille, Ladipoe, DNA Twins, Rema, Ayra Starr, Magixx and Boy Spyce. In Don Jazzy’s celebration post on Instagram, he shared a video, highlighting the journey, and captioned “My baby is 10 years old today. We are filled with joy as we celebrate #MavinAt10.” He further besieged his fans to continue their support for the record label. “Thank you so much for all the love and support all through the years. Pls we need your continuous support as always as we are just getting started. More greatness ahead. #Mavin” Mavin Records is arguably the biggest record label in Africa and one of the best in the world.
