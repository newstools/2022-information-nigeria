Senator Shehu Sani, a former lawmaker, has told Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike that Southern Governors did not betray him following the emergence of Atiku Abubakar as the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Presidential candidate for the 2023 general election. Sani, who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th National Assembly, believes the Southern Governors chose a formidable aspirant who could overcome northern sentiment, mobilize voters, and ultimately win the general elections by looking beyond the primaries. On Saturday, Atiku emerged as the PDP’s presidential candidate for the 2023 general election.
