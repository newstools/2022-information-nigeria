It will not be Muslims versus Christians or North versus South. It will be the poor versus the rich. So we must build the Nigerian economy to accommodate the poor. If you don’t accommodate the poor, you will run away. “Have you heard of Songhai farm? 300 hectares of Songhai farm, the biggest Songhai farm in the world was built by me.
