Reno Omokri, a former assistant to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has advised the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) not to call off their continuing strike if their members’ demands are not met. He mentioned this in a tweet on Tuesday, following the announcement by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of the arrest of the Accountant General of the Federation, Mr. Ahmed Idris, for suspected involvement in N80 billion in fraud and money laundering. According to reports, Nigeria’s accountant-general was arrested on Monday “after failing to honor invitations” from the EFCC to reply to the allegations. He urged the lecturers to demand that the Federal Government compensate them with the N80 billion purportedly stolen by Nigeria’s arrested treasury chief.

After all, the money you are asking for is not even up to ₦80 billion! “Just look at how morally bankrupt Nigeria is. The same Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, married a 16-year-old girl and he was not sacked or arrested by Buhari.”
