Adebanjo said, “Circumstances of the country and the nature of the government of Buhari has warranted my calling for the government for national unity. There is a state of emergency in the country that warrants drastic measures that are not necessarily contained in the constitution. “It is because of the deficiency and incompetence and unwillingness of the government to take advice from the leaders of the country who know better that we are calling for a government of national unity that all shades of opinion must be represented in that government.”
