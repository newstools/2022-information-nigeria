Oby Ezekwesili, Nigeria’s former Minister of Education, has criticized the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, for his response to calls for his resignation. Many Nigerians, including the former education minister, had urged Emefiele to quit as governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria or face being fired by President Muhammadu Buhari because of his presidential ambitions. According to reports, Emefiele’s supporters acquired the All Progressives Congress Expression of Interest and Nomination forms for him to run for president in 2023. Rice Farmers Association, Emefiele Support Group, and Friends of Godwin are said to have secured the forms for him on Friday. The CBN governor had previously rejected any involvement in the presidential contest, but on Saturday he reversed his position. Emefiele said he will decide whether or not to run in a few weeks in reaction to the public anger over his acquisition of nomination papers.
