The clergywoman in a video making the rounds online, was heard advising women to keep themselves clean and appealing. She said: “Let the women bathe, make sure you bathe, wash, scrape all the scrapeableq. As you’re going home now, buy shaving stick. Buy it, go and do personal sanitation”. She also urged women to do away with their torn undies. “Change it. Pant is not expensive. Look nice so when you present it, it’s nice”, she said. She claimed to be laying emphasis on women’s personal hygiene because of what she has seen. She relayed the experience of a man who did not sleep with his wife for 2 years.
