You must have peace for investors to come in, for people to set up industries. So the basic thing in my first six months as president of Nigeria is to end banditry,” he said in a statement released by Kelvin Ebiri, his media aide. “All those bandits, let them wait for me. I will pursue them. It is my job. I will provide to security agencies whatever they require.”
