If elected, Peter Obi, a presidential hopeful for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), claims he will replace the monthly allocation sharing system with a production model. According to NAN, Obi, an industrialist, revealed this in Calabar when he visited PDP delegates ahead of the party’s presidential primary on May 28 and May 29. The former Anambra governor stated that if the country is to survive, everyone must be productive, noting that other countries were busy producing while Nigeria was busy sharing and consuming. He stated that it was not the time to dance and celebrate as a country, but rather to work and repair the country. “Nigeria is a nation of over 200 million people with about 100 million living in poverty, over 18 million out of school children out of which about 10 million are girls,” Obi said.
