 A lion bit off the overzealous zoo attendant’s finger at an attraction in St Elizabeth, one of Jamaica’s largest parishes. According to reports, the incident occurred around 4:22 p.m. on Friday, May 20. Eyewitnesses who filmed the unfortunate incident revealed that the zoo was about to close when the zoo attendant attempted to pet or tease the lion in an apparent attempt to impress visitors. After sticking his hand through the chain-linked lion’s cage, the Zoo attendant paid the ultimate price when his right ring finger was partially bitten off.
