 A young lady has shared her inspiring transformation after deciding to stop bleaching her skin. One of the main reasons people choose to bleach and become lighter is because they believe it will help them gain acceptance. However, a woman’s Facebook story showed how she returned to her original ebony skin tone years after she stopped bleaching. She shared before and after photos of herself to commemorate her return to her former self, as well as revealing that the journey began in 2020 and emphasizing that it is never too late to do the right thing. Her story led many to state that nothing beats being natural and appreciating ones skin.
