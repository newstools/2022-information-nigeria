I will replicate what I have done in Akwa Ibom on the national scale and Nigeria will be better for it. “Why do I need to step out? It is because Nigeria needs what I am already providing in Akwa Ibom. All that remains is for me to take that from the sub-national to national level. “I understand the language of the economy. I have hands-on experience. We have a lot of things to show for our capacity and capability. “If we can do these at the sub-national level where we do not control policies, we will do more if we get the opportunity to control policies at the national level.”
