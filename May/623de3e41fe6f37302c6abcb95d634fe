This disunity is because the APC government has not been fair to all parts of this country. “I promise to unify this country and I promise to give a sense of belonging to every part of this country. We have done it before in 1999. When we came, there was a lot of disunity, but it was not as bad as this. “The first thing we did was to make sure we formed a government of national unity and that gave us the calmness and the unity we needed to govern. As long as the country is not united, as long as there is no peace, you cannot govern it even in your home not to talk of a complex country like Nigeria which is multi-ethnic and multi-religious. So, I promise to give every part of this country a sense of belonging, that was why I said I was going to restore unity.”
