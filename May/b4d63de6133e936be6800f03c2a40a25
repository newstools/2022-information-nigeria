 Nigerian dancer, Korra Obidi, has accused her estranged husband, Justin Dean, of stealing 5000 dollars from her. Obidi, in a Facebook live video on Saturday, said she mistakenly sent the money into their joint account after which Dean immediately emptied it immediately. Expressing anger over the development, Obidi said she could no longer be silent over issues in her marriage. She said: “The reason I have been silent over the marriage was that the internet never forgets. I did not want to speak about my divorce in public, it was a decision I made, knowing that the internet never forgets and considering that I’m putting my children first. “But at this juncture, I have no choice but to do what I’m doing right now.” Obidi lamented that she had gotten a lot of bills to pay including a $21,000 meant for the lawyer over their divorce case, saying Dean had not been responsible for any bills. She said she was ready to now fight everything with her last blood. “He must return the money tomorrow or I would come out with all evidences, including all the abuses I have faced,” she added. Dean had since filed a divorce to end his marriage with the singer, which, according to Korra in the Facebook live video, is still under processing.
