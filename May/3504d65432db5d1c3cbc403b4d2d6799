 Celebrated Nigerian entrepreneur and businessman, Obinna Iyiegbu, affectionately called Obi Cubana has taken to his Instagram account to warn netizens not to interact with a Twitter account in his name as the user(s) if the account is impersonating him and scamming people with his name. According to Obi Cubana, he is not on Twitter and does not transact any kind of business on social media.
