Senate President Ahmad Lawan has expressed that the security situation in the country will improve before the end of President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure. Speaking during a visit to Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai, Shehu of Borno, on Wednesday, Lawan stated that security is progressively improving. More than 30 persons were killed after insurgents invaded farms in Rann, Kala-Balge LGA of Borno state on Sunday. Lawan, who was in the state to meet with All Progressives Congress (APC) delegates, suspended the engagement.

We are very hopeful that before this administration will complete its tenure next year, we will have a better security situation in this part of the country and indeed in all parts of the country by the Grace of God.”
