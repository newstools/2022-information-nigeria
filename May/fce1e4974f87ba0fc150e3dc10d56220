Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has stated that any aspirant that should be fielded by the party for the 2023 elections “must commit to the formation of a Government of National Unity.” His suggestion came some days after the national chairman of the APC, Abdullahi Adamu, promised that the party would present its finest candidates ahead of the 2023 general election. Olawepo-Hashim in a statement on Wednesday maintained that the Government of National Unity must be made up of credible Nigerians to unite the country.
