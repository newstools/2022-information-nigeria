 Tom Cruise made it clear there was no chance “Top Gun: Maverick” would be released first on a streaming platform despite multiple pandemic delays, as he visited Cannes on Wednesday. “I make movies for the big screen… I love this experience and I want other filmmakers to have that experience,” Cruise told an audience at the Cannes Film Festival. He was speaking ahead of the European premiere of the much-anticipated sequel to his 1986 blockbuster.

Asked if he had considered debuting “Top Gun: Maverick” on a streaming platform — as happened with several big productions in 2020 and 2021 — Cruise was emphatic: “That was not going to happen, ever.” “Look at us all together, we’re all united, we all speak different languages, different cultures… but we’re able to come together around a shared experience,” he said of his love for movie theatres. “Cinema is my love, my passion.

I tell them: ‘I know what you’re going through, just know we’re making ‘Mission: Impossible’, ‘Top Gun’ is coming out…”
