 Ace Afrobeats singer, David Adeleke also known as Davido has penned a food for thought which is specifically addressed to rich individuals. He said that because some people are wealthy enough to have fast cars, big houses and VIP seats at occasions, does not mean that they have been bestowed with the right to demean those in the lower class. Davido, who took to his Twitter page to drop the quote on Saturday, May 21 said there is no price tag attached to class or decency. He wrote; ”Money might get you a faster car, bigger house or the best VIP seats but it doesn’t give you the right to treat others with less any differently. Class and decency have no price tag attached. Be Kind!!!” The singer captioned it; ”Food for thought” See his post: Food for thought pic.twitter.com/ocg3lTyHe1 — Davido (@davido) May 21, 2022
