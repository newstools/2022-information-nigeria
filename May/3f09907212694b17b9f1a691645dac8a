The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Hassan Kukah, on Saturday said he is safe after protests rocked parts of Sokoto city over the detention of two persons linked to the gruesome killing of Deborah Samuel. In contrast to several internet accounts, the Bishop further stated that his home was not set on fire. To restore order, the state government enforced a 24-hour curfew. Kukah issued a message to Channels Television calling for calm and commending Governor Aminu Tambuwal for implementing the curfew so quickly.
