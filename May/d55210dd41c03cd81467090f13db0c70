The governor of Ebonyi, Dave Umahi, believes that the south-east should produce the next president in the interests of justice, equity, and fairness. During a meeting between President Muhammadu Buhari and leaders of the zone on Friday in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi capital, the governor remarked. Umahi, a presidential hopeful, stated political reasons were used to ensure that the south-west produced the president in 1999, and that if other southern regions sincerely favor equity, the south-east should win the presidential ticket in 2023. “The south producing the presidency is a moral question which should be answered by its components,” Umahi said.
