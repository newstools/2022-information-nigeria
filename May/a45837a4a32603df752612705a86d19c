Omoyele Sowore, a presidential hopeful on the African Action Congress (AAC) platform, says he turned down President Muhammadu Buhari’s invitation to meet with him after he was elected in 2015. Sowore spoke out over the weekend as a guest on 90MinutesAfrica’s presidential candidate interview talk show. In response to a question about how he and other Nigerians helped Buhari win the presidency in 2015, the activist stated that he and other Nigerians did not work for Buhari’s victory.

I have never met Buhari before and I don’t have any plans to meet him.”
