On Monday, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, the Emir of Ilorin, backed Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, an All Progressives Congress presidential hopeful. The Emir stated that the APC leader “deserves to be the next Nigerian President” as he received members of the South West Agenda for Asiwaju 2023 at his palace in Ilorin. The Emir’s support for Tinubu comes as a native of the state and former Senate President Bukola Saraki, a traditional titleholder, is also running for the seat.
