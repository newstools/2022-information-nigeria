A former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi, has joined the Labour Party few days after dumping the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party, saying the party is the right platform that aligns with his aspiration. He stated that he had chosen a route that he considered to be in line with “our aspirations and my mantra of taking the country from consumption to production.” Obi disclosed this in a series of tweets on his Twitter handle on Friday. He wrote, “I thank all Nigerians, especially our youths who have joined me in the mission of taking back and reuniting Nigeria. This project is yours and for the future of your children. I am just a facilitator.
