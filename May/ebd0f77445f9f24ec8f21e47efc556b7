Saraki made his intention known at a breakfast meeting with journalists and some of his associates in Abuja on Thursday. The former Kwara governor stated that he is running because there is a need to address problems that have been confronting the country for years. “We all have reasons to be worried about the future of this country. But this is not the time to surrender and wallow in despair,” he said.
