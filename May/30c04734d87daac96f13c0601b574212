And I do, quite honestly, believe that I understand the dynamics of Nigeria. “I understand this country very well and I have a fair knowledge of its people and their concerns. I believe that I can be that unifier that this country can accept as the candidate of our party, and I can be used by the party to win the elections convincingly. “I believe that if the PDP should, at the end of the day, give me the ticket of the party by his grace, we will win the elections convincingly, because I am that bridge that Nigerians need — a bridge between the old and the young, and the bridge that will now continue to reconnect every part of this country. I believe I have all of those qualities.”
