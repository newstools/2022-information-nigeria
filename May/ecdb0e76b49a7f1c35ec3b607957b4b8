But it is really about Nigeria. There are aspirations everywhere and there are so many qualified people. “But for equity and fairness we have in our country, I think it’s just morally fair that it goes to that part and South-West is top-notch in that. We believe that our positions from those meetings are still very valid and everybody must consider them,” he said.
