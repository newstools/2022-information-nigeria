 Nigerian veteran actor, Lere Paimo who is known for his superb interpretation of roles in movies is set to return to the screen for Seun Oloketuyi’s biopic of late Lamidi Adedibu. The biopic ‘Adedibu, Alagbara Ibadan’ is a story about the life and times of Chief Lamidi Ariyibi Akanji Adedibu, his achievements, and his impact on Oyo State and Nigeria, This was revealed by Seun Oloketuyi, the founder of the Best of Nollywood (BON) Awards and Ultimate Communications, following the completion of the filming in Ibadan, the capital of Oyo State. The Abiodun Jimoh directed film, stars veteran Lere Paimo as the lead along with Dele Odule, Afeez ‘Saka’ Oyetoro, Segun Arinze, Kayode ‘Aderupoko’ Olaiya, Shushu Abubakar, Adekola ‘Kamilu Kompo’ Tijani, Taiwo Ibikunle, and many more. While speaking about the biopic, Seun Oloketuyi restated what he has pointed out as the reason for making the biopics he has worked on with the major reason being telling stories of people relevant to the country’s political history. “Many of the people that are relevant to our political history as a nation are being forgotten, and no one is going to help us remember them. This is my bit to ensure that it doesn’t happen. Adedibu made too much of an impact to allow memories of his time to be forgotten.” The biopic is set for a July 2022 release.
