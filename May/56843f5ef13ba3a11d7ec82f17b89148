 Shina Peller Begs For Donations To Run For President, Senate In 2023 Nigerian politician, Shina Peller has declared interest in the Presidential seat on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform as well as a senatorial slot in Oyo. Mr Peller, who currently serves as the Federal Representative for the Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwajowa constituency announced his ambition on Wednesday while seeking funds.  Announcing it on social media, he wrote; ”THE DIE IS CAST In recent times, I have had several support groups clamouring that I make bold political moves. I sincerely thank them for their trust and concern. While there are calls for me to run for the senate others say I should throw my hat into the presidency ring. As a leader, I understand that I must make tough decisions and make tough sacrifices to enhance the lives of people around me. I am not oblivious to the fact that persons of interest are donating to further this cause, however, the reality of our political system where delegates decide on the fate of millions makes the yearnings of the youth even more difficult. I appreciate everyone for their time and sacrifice. This is not about me but the next generation – I have always been committed to building a new generation of leaders. As young and credible people, it’s about time we make strong demands from our party. We must bring our negotiation strength and skills to the table even as political party primaries fast approach. To this end, a meeting by the coalition of Progressives Young Nigerians shall be taking place at Ikeja Airport Hotel, on Thursday 5th of May, by 3 pm. Young people seeking elective positions in the country are invited.”
