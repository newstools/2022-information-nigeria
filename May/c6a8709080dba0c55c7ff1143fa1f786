Peter Obi, a presidential hopeful for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has promised to transform Nigeria from a consuming to a producing economy if he is elected president of the country in the 2023 presidential election. Obi, a former governor of Anambra State, made the commitment while meeting with PDP delegates in Kaduna State to request their support and vote in the upcoming primary election. Obi, who decried the country’s mounting insecurity, told the delegates that his administration would combat insecurity by creating jobs for millions of citizens and creating a favorable atmosphere for businesses to prosper.
