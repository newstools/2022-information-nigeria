Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has stated that his presidential aspiration is not an act of betrayal of his erstwhile political associate, Bola Tinubu. He spoke on Wednesday when he featured on Channels Television’s ‘Politics Today.’ Fayemi, the current Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, had earlier on Wednesday declared his intention to run for the office of the President in 2023. The Ekiti governor and member of the All Progressives Congress is in the race with Tinubu, who is also interested in clinching the presidential ticket of the ruling party at the APC primary election later this month.

However, speaking on Wednesday night, Fayemi said, “Running for office is not an ambition; I’ve always maintained that it is service, it is sacrifice, it is duty.” On his relationship with Tinubu, Fayemi said, “I’ve had a very good relationship with Asiwaju Bola Tinubu whom I met in exile in 1994 when he came out after the annulment of the election and the establishment of NADECO (National Democratic Coalition)…We maintained a very cordial relationship ever since then. “I don’t believe that we should see that as a basis for demonizing anyone and I know that the Asiwaju that I know, that I have interacted with would not subscribe to that. I don’t believe that he will use terminologies like betrayal. “This is not an inheritance; it is about Nigeria – Nigeria is the commonwealth of all Nigerians. It is not a traditional title that we are seeking, the office we are seeking is to make an improvement for all Nigerians.”
