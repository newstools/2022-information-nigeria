Consequently, on this premise, Nigerians and the international communities are, by this statement, duly informed that the lives of my immediate family and I are under severe threat, and should any harm or eventuality come to any of us, we know those who are responsible for it, and this has been duly registered in the appropriate quarters. “I am speaking the truth and nothing but the truth. It is my firm belief that every Nigerian has a right to run, and the voice of the people will prevail. No life should therefore be threatened in the line of duty.”
