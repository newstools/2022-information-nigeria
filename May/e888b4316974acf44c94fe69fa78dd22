The Peter Obi Support Network (POSN) has stated that the former governor of Anambra remains in the presidential race and isn’t interested in negotiating a vice-presidential slot. Obi had, in March, officially declared his intention to contest the presidency on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). There have been speculations that the presidential hopeful may concede to a vice-presidential slot of the PDP. However, in a statement on Thursday, Sani Altukry, on behalf of POSN, stated that Obi is in the race to clinch the party’s presidential ticket.
