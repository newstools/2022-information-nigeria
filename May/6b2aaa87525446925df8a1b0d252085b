 Adunni Ade, a well-known Nigerian actress, has slammed her colleagues for using fake pages to troll her because she lacks big butts. People always body shame the single mother of two, she said on Instagram, forgetting that she looks “damn good at her age.” ‘Jobless colleagues,’ Adunni Ade said, and they should mind their own business and leave her alone. Sharing a video of herself rocking the all black ensemble she rocked to AMVCA’s Fashion Runway show, she wrote, “In 2022, we see people still body shaming folks out here? I look damn good at my age!
