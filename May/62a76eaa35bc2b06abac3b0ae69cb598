 2baba’s fans were concerned after he appeared almost teary in an emotional video in which he begged God to protect his children’s lives and give them strength. The singer’s video comes just a few days after he visited Sound Sultan’s grave in the United States. Many speculated that the video post indicated that the African Queen crooner was going through a tough time. @Willaims Silo wrote: “Hope all is well boss?

Your children are safe.” Watch Video Below   A post shared by Innocent Idibia (@official2baba)
