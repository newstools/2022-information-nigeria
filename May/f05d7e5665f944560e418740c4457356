Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, has advised the Independent National Electoral Commission not to stampede the major political parties over the conduct of their primaries. According to him, INEC’s insistence that political parties complete their primaries by June 3, 2022, is not something the electoral body should compel. He called it hypocritical that INEC, which had postponed several polls on election day, would refuse to budge on the primary deadline. “Party primaries are an integral part of the democratic process, and it is bewildering that INEC is not even interested in debates between aspirants, which remains a huge opportunity to define party platforms”, he said in a statement on Thursday.

The right for political parties to internally regulate themselves is an essential part of their freedom of association, in as much as their actions do not violate the constitution and the Electoral Act”, he said.
