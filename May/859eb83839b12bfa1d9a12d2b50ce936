Ahmad Lawan, Senate President and All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, has stated that he is still running for president. In a statement made on Sunday by the Spokesperson of Ahmad Lawan Presidential Campaign Organization, Mr Iyke Ekeoma, Lawan categorically denied standing for re-election in Yobe East Senatorial District. He denied claims that he was withdrawing from the presidential race to run for another term in the Senate, and he urged his followers not to be afraid since he is working relentlessly to become the APC’s nominee. Lawan described as mischief, the reports that he has withdrawn from the race, noting that those who planted the report were jittery of his political popularity, regional acceptance and dominance in political space hence, they cooked the fake report to create confusion. He said, “Nigerians should ignore the sponsored lies by some aspirants to distract the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, from his quest to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in the next presidential election.
