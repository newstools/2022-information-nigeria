 An Odigbo Magistrate’s Court has sentenced two men, Abdulai Ibrahim, 26; and Dauda Mohammed, 22, to ten years imprisonment for stealing three cows valued at N900,000 in Ondo State. The Magistrate, D.O. Ogunfuyi, found the two guilty and sentenced them accordingly based on their guilty pleas. In his decision, Ogunfuyi condemned the first defendant to three years in prison on count one and two years on count two, while the second defendant was sentenced to three years in prison on count one and two years on count two. According to the charge sheet, the defendants, Ibrahim, Mohammed and Tajudeen Adiamot conspired to take and receive stolen goods on April 27, 2022, at midnight in Sabo Odigbo town in the Ore magisterial district.

“That you, Abdulai Ibrahim ‘M’ and Dauda Mohammed ‘M’ on the same date time and place in the aforementioned Magisterial District stole three cows valued at about N900,000, property of one Abubakar Mohammed,” the charge read. Sections 516, 390(9), and 427 of the Criminal Code, Cap 37, Vol 1, Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria 2006, prohibit the offences. When the charge was read to the first and second defendants, who did not have legal representation, they pleaded guilty to the offences, but the third defendant pleaded not guilty.
