He promised to be there for me even followed me to my grandparents house, I won’t lie I took in for him but I was naive so it resulted to abor*ion which he paid for it, Getting to this year, we started communicating again, we kindled and he was still proposing to me as he claims till I found out around April I didn’t see my period I told him about it and he said i should keep it, I’m ready to keep it at as a consolation for my first mistake”
