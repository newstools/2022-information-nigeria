The governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, has stated that he might not run for president. Some groups bought the APC’s presidential nomination form for the CBN governor on Friday, urging him to run for president in 2023. However, Emefiele stated on Saturday that he has not made up his mind about running for president in 2023. The CBN governor stated that the decision is difficult to make and that it will require divine intervention. God would guide him in his decision “during the next few days,” he continued. “I am humbled by the growing interest of those asking that I run for the Office of President in the 2023 general elections: I have not come to that decision,” his tweet reads.
