 A video making the rounds online has captured a young Nigerian lady showing off wads of N20 and N50 she received at her birthday. In the video going viral on social media, the lady was seen showing off her dance moves with huge wads of cash placed in front of her. As she danced joyfully, she was heard screaming that she would never go broke again in life. It was gathered that the money was sprayed on her by her friends at her recent birthday party. Reacting to the video, Nigerians tackled her as they claimed that the money she was flaunting is too small. Opeyemi said,
“U are already broke. This money too small to do anything. Better start praying”. Watch video below,   A post shared by GossipMillNaija (@gossipmilltv)
