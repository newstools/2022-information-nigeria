 Controversial Nollywood actress Tonto Dikeh has reacted to the demolition of his former boyfriend’s Abuja house. Prince Kpokpogri had cried out after his palatial home was demolished by the Federal Capital Development Agency (FCDA). The politician took to his Instagram live on Saturday, May 14, 2022, where he shared videos of the agency pulling down his fence. The traumatized Kpokpogri cried for help as the agency pulled down his fence while trying to gain access to the main building. In reaction to this, Tonto Dikeh mocked him on her Instagram page, revealing how the embattled prince wished her son death, after the loss of her mum. For Tonto Dikeh, Kpokpogri got what he truly deserves for messing with ‘wrong woman’.
