Former Lagos governor Bola Tinubu, who is running for president of the All Progressives Congress (APC), claims that if elected, he can make Edo state as “beautiful” as Lagos. He made the remarks during a meeting with APC delegates in Edo state on Saturday, ahead of the party’s presidential primary. Adams Oshiomhole, former APC national chairman, and Ize Iyamu, the party’s candidate in the 2020 Edo governorship race, were present during the meeting. Speaking on his ambitions for the state, Tinubu, who claimed he wouldn’t be able to stay as long as he’d like, said that the APC will win the next governorship race.
