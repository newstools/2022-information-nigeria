 Kemi Olunloyo, a controversial journalist, laments Tonto Dikeh’s obsession, despite threats to have the journalist arrested. This follows an interview granted to the thespian’s ex-lover, which quickly escalated into back-and-forth tantrums between the two. Tonto Dikeh took to Instagram to announce her arrival in Lagos, claiming to have Kemi’s home address after she was accused of drug use. In response, Kemi Olunloyo wrote a Twitter thread in which she questioned the mother of one’s obsession with her. “Ms Tonto Dikeh

Her visa was later cancelled and she was sent back to Nigeria. Tonto Dikeh’s friends also told me that she can never pass a drug test.

I hope Tonto will not be admitted forcefully into a hospital while she’s in Lagos. Journalist Hamid said she fought 🇦🇪security men who busted her😳 Wishing Tonto Dikeh well. Rehabilitation works.
