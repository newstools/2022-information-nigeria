According to Elder Statesman Edwin Clark, the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, should take up negotiations over the Academic Staff Union of Universities’ strike. In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja, the elder statesman stated that Adamu was in a better position to reach a sensible compromise with ASUU. He stated that education issues should be handled by someone who understands the impact of the strike, adding that it is hurting every fibre of the economy. According to him, in addition to the long-term impact, the strike has skewed the school calendar, increased crime rates, and impoverished communities that rely on schools, among other things. “The Federal Ministry of Education should take over negotiation from labour because the labour ministry is treating ASUU case like any other industrial matter.
