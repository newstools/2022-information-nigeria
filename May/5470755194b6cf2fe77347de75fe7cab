The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has stated that Nigeria’s democracy is being threatened by the predominance of money politics. Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman, stated this on Wednesday at a one-day colloquium on emerging issues that will shape the 2023 general election. The event was organised by the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) in collaboration with the Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) in Abuja. Yakubu pointed out that there are three critical challenges ahead of the 2023 election, listing them as insecurity, fake news and money politics.
