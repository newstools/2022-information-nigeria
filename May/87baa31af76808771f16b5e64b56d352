Ex-President Goodluck Jonathan’s former aide, Reno Omokri, has stated that his former principal won’t join the 2023 presidential race secretly. Omokri stated this while reacting to the purchase of the N100 million Nomination and Expression of Interest forms of the APC for his former principal by some groups. The former president had, however, said the forms were bought without his consent.

He has an official spokesman and his own staff. He is a man of honour and will not do anything surreptitiously. The media and the public should be guided. “I could have denied this hours ago, but I deliberately declined in order to watch his enemies and mine dance deliriously at the thought that they’d demystified @GEJonathan. There is no Nigerian alive that has the national and international credibility that HE GEJ has.”
