I have no other reason or objective except to serve. “After one has been in office as Vice President for seven years, I know that God did not give me that opportunity so that I would sit down somewhere and write the history of my service as Vice President. “It is for the purpose of serving the people, and that is why I am so determined that if God gives me the opportunity to serve, the Nigerian people would realise indeed they have done the right thing by putting me in office because I would serve the country with everything, with all my heart and commitment.”
