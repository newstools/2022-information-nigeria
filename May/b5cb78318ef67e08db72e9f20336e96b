On Thursday in Rivers State, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo stated that despite the number of contenders vying for the All Progressives Congress presidential ticket, they must be willing to gather around and support whoever emerges as the candidate in the upcoming primary elections. This was because he stated that there was no reason for antagonism among aspirants because the end goal remained national unity. Osinbajo spoke in Rivers as part of his nationwide consultations with stakeholders and APC delegates, according to a statement signed on Friday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande.

He said, “We are all progressives, we represent the same point of view that this country can be better; that we can improve the fortunes of our young people; that our country can be a great place. Every one of us has that desire, and every one of us can achieve that, given the chance. “Everywhere I’ve gone, I’ve pointed out that there is no need for conflict of any kind, especially among presidential aspirants. All of us, who are presidential aspirants, have either worked together or eaten together in one place or the other. We are aspirants today, but only one person would emerge, and we must be prepared to work with that person.”
