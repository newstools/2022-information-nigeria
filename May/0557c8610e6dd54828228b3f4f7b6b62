A presidential hopeful, Adamu Garba, has joined the Young Progressives Party (YPP) and purchased the party’s presidential expression of interest and nomination form. Garba told reporters in Abuja after picking up his form at the party’s national office on Tuesday that he wants to build a “new Nigeria” by repairing the country’s foundation. The presidential candidate claimed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have no future for the youth. “The youth don’t have a future in the APC or PDP. I was a strong member of the PDP in 1999, in 2003 we moved to ANPP and in 2007 we came to PDP and stayed till 2014 when APC founded and we moved,” he said.

A vision that will go to the foundation and reset for the Nigerian state. The reason why we have been failing consistently in this country is because the foundation is faulty. “The system was established at the point of division – that makes us see each other as different people whereas we share the same geography.”
