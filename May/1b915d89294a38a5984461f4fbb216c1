Senior Pastor of the Citadel Global Community Church, Tunde Bakare, has expressed optimism that he will pick the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress. The clergyman had last week bought the N100m expression of interest and nomination forms of the ruling party, joining over 20 others who had already procured the forms. Bakare, who was at the International Conference Centre in Abuja on Wednesday to submit his forms, stated that he already envisaged himself replacing President Muhammadu Buhari.

I am eminently qualified either by age or experience or everything that counts in this race.

We have fulfilled our own side; it is now for the party to set the stage and to tell us what is next. “What I know for now is that by the grace of God, we have decided to run according to the rules and we expect to win.”
