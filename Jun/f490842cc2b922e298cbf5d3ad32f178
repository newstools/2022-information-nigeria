CHARIS Royale Initiative (CRI), a Lagos faith-based organisation, has advised Bola Ahmed Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to pick Simon Lalong, governor of Plateau, as his running mate. Explaining their choice of Lalong, the group stated that the Plateau governor has, in the last seven years, worked hard to ensure that there is no religious crisis in his state. Oludele Adeogun, interim national secretary of the group, stated that the advice was part of the group’s contribution to ensure that the masses, especially those of the Christian faith, have confidence in the APC presidential candidate. Adeogun said the recent attack on a Catholic Church in Owo remains a sore point in an attempt by some unscrupulous elements to pitch Christians against Muslims.
