According to the Most Rev. Mathew Hassan Kukah, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, democracy in Nigeria is not progressing at the right pace because those who make the laws benefit from the system. Kukah, the National Peace Committee’s Convener, made this statement while appearing on Channels Tv’s Sunrise Daily. He bemoaned the fact that the task of developing policies to drive democracy in the country had been delegated to politicians, who, he claimed, benefit greatly from such policies. The clergy said: “The problem with Nigeria’s situation is that the sinners are the ones trying to make the law. These are the consequences of where we find ourselves now.
