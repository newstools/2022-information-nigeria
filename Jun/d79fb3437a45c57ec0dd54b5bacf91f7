Judge Donnelly told Kelly he created a trail of broken lives, adding that ‘the most seasoned investigators will not forget the horrors your victims endured.’ She further stated, “these crimes were calculated and carefully planned and regularly executed for almost 25 years. “You taught them that love is enslavement and violence.
