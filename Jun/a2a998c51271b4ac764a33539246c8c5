Because according to Section 84 (Sections 9-10), if one person says, ‘I am not going to withdraw, there must be an election,” he said in reaction to the decision of the governors to reduce the aspirants to five. “As far as we are concerned, we are already set for election and if all the 23 people that are there as screened by the party and allowed for election, we would conduct election. “So the idea of pruning down to certain number of people that the governors did is just to reduce the number of people that we intend to support in order to reduce the tension. It is not necessarily to force anybody actually to step down.”
