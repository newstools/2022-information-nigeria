We must bring someone who can win the election and sustain what the APC has done. That is the exact definition of what the president said. “If you are looking for a name, the president didn’t mention a name, and neither did anybody mention a name. “He told us about his dreams of who will be president. The president said: ‘my dream of who will be the next president is this and I’m going to consult with other stakeholders, not just the governors, the aspirants themselves, and at the end of the day, we must remain a united party’. I think that is just the dream of the president.”
