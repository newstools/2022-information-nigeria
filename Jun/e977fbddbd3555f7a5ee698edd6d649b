This is coming a few weeks after loved-up videos of Ruger and Susan Pwajok popped online and many Nigerians started speculating that they are dating. However, Ruger during an interview on Clout Africa’s Clout Talk concert 2.0 which was hosted by popular skit maker and actor, Broda Shaggi reacted to the romance speculations. A fan asked him to address his rumoured affair with Susan and the ‘Dior’ crooner debunked the speculations saying the actress has been his best friend for a long time.
