Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west and presidential hopeful, has stated that he has what it takes to win the presidential election for the All Progressives Congress (APC). Okorocha made it to the APC presidential screening in the last hours of the exercise on Tuesday, after he was able to perfect his bail conditions to leave the custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Speaking on Wednesday when he featured on a programme on ARISE TV, Okorocha stated that he has the political influence in the north to win the presidential election.

I’m a darling in the north. I have relationships in the north. “If I run for election in Adamawa state today, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar will sweat for defeat. “I can say that because I know what I have done in Adamawa.
