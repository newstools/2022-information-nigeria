When asked whether he is hopeful of emerging winner of the APC presidential primary, Badaru said, “My hope is very high. I travelled to various parts of the country on official APC assignments and delivered them. I won election in Bayelsa for the APC. I was in Ondo, Ekiti, Osun Bauchi, among other places on campaign missions. All the missions were successful. “Delegates know me and I know them. In 2011, I led the APC convention. They have seen my scorecard. I led election committee during our latest convention. “I relate with them well. I travelled to many states on reconciliation missions or election matters or aspirants screening. They respect me and I respect them. Delegates can collect (money) from every aspirant, but will only vote for a credible person.”
