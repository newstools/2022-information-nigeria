 Nigerian singer Kizz Daniel has stirred mixed reactions online, after refusing to collect a flower bouquet at the airport in Zambia. In the video making the rounds online, Kizz Daniel after he arrived at the airport was approached by a lady holding a huge bouquet of flowers but he merely acknowledged her. Notwithstanding Kizz Daniels’ bodyguard accepted the flower on his behalf. The video also captured reporters attempting to get a response from the singer on what his Zambian fans should expect from him but he kept silent. This generated angry reactions from Zambian fans stating that Kizz Daniels’ action at the airport was uncalled for while some Nigerians defended him. row_dah18 wrote: “Abeg, even Queen Elizabeth collects flowers from people but to each their own sha” abagbodi wrote: “But he appreciated it, by touching his chest as sign of love” Graced Mandy wrote: “Kizz Daniel is my favourite Nigerian artist but that behaviour is Uncalled for.
