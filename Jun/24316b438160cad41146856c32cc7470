 Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno, has apologised for his comments about Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. In an interview on Friday, Shettima had described Osinbajo as a nice person, but noted that such an attitude will not make him a good president. He said “nice men should be selling popcorn, ice cream” while adding that Bola Tinubu, former Lagos governor, will make a better president. The utterance has stirred negative reactions from political figures within and outside the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). In response, Shettima, in a tweet on his verified Twitter handle on Sunday, said his remarks were not meant as “ridicule but, rather, to stir up interest in the contrasting virtues of the cast of aspirants putting up a fight against my preferred aspirant”.

None of them is an opponent, so their aspiration isn’t a threat to us. “They appear so in the sprint to become the party’s presidential flag-bearer in the 2023 elections, but they are our allies in the marathon. “My assessments of the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, and Ahmad Lawan, were well-intentioned. “I never set out to subject them to ridicule but, rather, to stir up interest in the contrasting virtues of the cast of aspirants putting up a fight against my preferred aspirant, one most favoured and advantaged to guarantee APC’s victory in the forthcoming presidential election.” The statement read partly.
