The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Wednesday has stated that its National Chairman, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, has not been suspended from office. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, disclosed this via a statement on Wednesday amid a social media report that Ayu has been suspended by the NWC. “Such report is completely false and a product of the imagination of mischief-makers with the intent to destabilize our Party, create an impression of crisis within our ranks, and mislead the unsuspecting members of the public,” the statement read in part.
