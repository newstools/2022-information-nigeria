 Nigerian media personality and TV host Toke Makinwa who recently got engaged to her boo has stirred mixed reactions online. Recall the 37-year-old got married to a fitness trainer Maje Ayida on the 15th of January 2014, after dating for 8 years but the marriage lasted for 18 months before it crashed, after Maje impregnated his ex-girlfriend. However, Toke Makinwa who seemed like she wouldn’t be finding love any time soon took to her Instagram page to hint at her engagement. The news came as a shock to some Nigerians considering how Toke Makinwa had often advised ladies about romantic relationships. From saying a lady does not need a man to be happy to a piece of advice on the need to sign an agreement or document with a man before going into a relationship, Toke Makinwa seemed to have eaten her own words. While some netizens congratulated him, others reminded her of her words. donsettlenaija wrote: “Last last naija feminist na scam” stanleykingx__ wrote: “Una motivational speaker of you don’t need a man don engage oo” ayam_omofaak wrote: Congratulations to her Change is the only constant thing in life May she enjoy her new chapter arniesuperstar wrote: “I’m so happy for you @tokemakinwa .just do it afraid babygirl!
