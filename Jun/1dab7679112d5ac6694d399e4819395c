Nigerian Afrobeat singer, Davido has been criticised online after calling his ex-fiancee and celebrity chef Chioma Avril Rowland a drunkard. Chioma took to her Instagram page to share new photos of herself rocking a blond hairstyle and videos of herself and friends while at a party over the weekend. The celebrity chef also wore a pink low-cut neck dress as she beams with a huge smile on her face. In one of the videos, Chioma was seen dancing and looked a bit tipsy. Davido reacted to the post, calling Chioma a drunkard and she smiled with laughing emojis. He wrote: “Drunkie” However, the statement got many fans displeased as they tackled Davido for publicly disrespecting his ex-lover.
