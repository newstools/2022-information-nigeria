President Muhammadu Buhari has ruled out bail for the detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu. He said Kanu, who is currently on trial, was being given every opportunity under the law “to justify all the uncomplimentary things said against Nigeria while he was in Britain.” According to a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President said this at a bilateral meeting with the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on the margins of the 26th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, Rwanda on Thursday.

We eventually got him when he stepped out of the United Kingdom, and we sent him to court. Let him defend all that he said there.” He said considering Kanu’s jumping of bail earlier, the Federal Government may not consider granting him such a privilege anymore. Buhari said, “His (Kanu’s) lawyers have access to him. Remember he jumped bail before, how are we sure he won’t do it again if he’s admitted to bail?”
