Special Adviser on Civic Engagement to Osun State Governor, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, has predicted a landslide victory for Governor Gboyega Oyetola in July 16 governorship poll. Oyintiloye disclosed this on Sunday while addressing members of Nigerian Incorporated Electronic Practitioners, Osun State Chapter during an engagement meeting organised by the Civic Engagement Office held in Osogbo on Sunday. Representing Oyetola at the meeting, Oyintiloye stated that the campaign of calumny by the opposition parties against the present administration would not stop the incumbent governor’s reelection. He stated that the landslide victory recorded by the All Progressives Congress in the Ekiti governorship election would be replicated for APC during Osun poll.
