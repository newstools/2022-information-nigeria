Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has stated that he would like to see a constitutional amendment that will make it a duty for the citizen to vote, rather than a right. He made this statement on Tuesday at the 6th Babatunde Raji Fashola (BRF) Gabfest held in Lagos while reacting to the perceived increase in Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) collection and what should motivate the citizens to get involved in voting their representatives into elective offices. Fashola insisted that no system was perfect, adding that he does not subscribe to the notion that the Nigerian situation was hopeless.

Let us pay attention to the local government… because we all seem to be fixated on who becomes the president,” he said.
