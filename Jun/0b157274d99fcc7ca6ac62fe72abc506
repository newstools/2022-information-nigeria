Former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Babachir Lawal believes Bola Tinubu will defeat Atiku Abubakar in the 2023 presidential election in Adamawa. Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, and Atiku, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, are the frontrunners in the election. Atiku, who is from Adamawa, is widely expected to win his home state, but the former SGF believes otherwise. Lawal claimed in an interview with Channels TV that the APC has tentacles all over the state and that Atiku will be defeated in 2023.

Tinubu is a very good man. He is a very kind man, and you need to hear from some of the people he has helped, so many all over the country. “He has sponsored people in Taraba, in Adamawa, in Gombe; he is somebody that has been helpful to almost every politician across the country.”
