 Former Big Brother Naija ‘Shine Ya Eye’ Housemate Angel Smith has come under heavy criticism after spilling details of how she has helped her colleague, Cross since the reality show ended. During the 9th episode of the reunion last night, Angel expressed that Cross has never for once reciprocated the same energy she gives in their friendship. According to Angel, she helps Cross whenever he needs money, had booked a Spa for him, cooked for him and even drove to the mainland to see him. In her words: “I know what I have done for Cross. When he has needs for money and comes to me, I never hesitate to give him. He has never spent on me. 3 times he was sick, I cooked for him. I don’t drive to mainland for whatever reason but cos of Cross I have. I booked a Spa fro him but he wasn’t reciprocating the same energy.” The statement generated reactions online as netizens slammed Angel for spiling such details on Live TV.
