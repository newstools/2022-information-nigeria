Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal has explained why he dropped his presidential bid to support Atiku Abubakar in the Peoples Democratic Party’s recent presidential primary. The governor, who was also a presidential contender on the party’s platform before withdrawing and urging his supporters to vote for Atiku, said it was a sacrifice for Nigerians and the country. The governor made the remarks while speaking to a crowd at the state government house on Friday, shortly after his return from Abuja. Tambuwal said, “Thank you very much our leaders and distinguished supporters from all over the country for your support and cooperation. I must thank leaders of our party here at Sokoto State level and every level.

The sacrifice that I have made on your behalf is aimed at strengthening our party, our democracy, and, by the grace of God, soft landing our polity. “This is in consonance with the teachings of our leaders and the [emulation] of the examples they have given to us in the past: that we must continue to make sacrifice for the good of all of us and our country. “I thank the people of Sokoto State and all my supporters across the country for their support. Rest assured, we shall work assiduously for the victory of our party come 2023 general election.”
