The build-back process is going to be collective and we’re trusting that all our party members would want to be part of that story at the end of the day. “The story, which will obviously be positive and we will yield positive results, will require that each and every one of us must support our principal as we move forward in the next months and that we will, at the end, win the election with a landslide victory. “And in doing so, we must create in ourselves a new self, a new approach to political issues, a new commitment, which I believe we all yearn for. It will require a lot of commitment from each and every one of us. “It will require the unity of each and every one of us in our various wards, local governments and states, we need the PDP to return to power.”
