Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has ordered all public and private institutions in the state to install Close Circuit Television (CCTV) devices. A statement signed by the Governor’s spokesperson, Richard Olatunde, on Saturday said Akeredolu has signed an Executive Order to that effect. “This becomes imperative in the light of the increased spate of insecurity in the country and the need to ensure security of lives and properties in all public and private institutions and centres throughout the state,” the statement said.
