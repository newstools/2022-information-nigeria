The Senate has finally read the defection letter of a former Governor of Kano State and Senator representing Kano Central Senatorial district, Ibrahim Shekarau. His defection was announced by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan after the lawmakers resumed plenary. Shekarau had defected from the All Progressive Party to the New Nigeria Peoples Party sometime in May but his defection letter was read on Wednesday. The Senator has also since received the NNPP membership card at his Giginyu ward in the presence of the party’s top echelons and politicians like the presidential candidate of the party, Dr Rabiu Kwankwaso, and a former member, House of Representatives, Sulieman Sumaila. Like others, Shekarau in his resignation letter, cited injustice, marginalisation and unfairness by Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje as reasons for his exit from the party.
