Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has urged Nigerians not to lose faith in the country, saying it will overcome its challenges. In his Democracy Day message on Sunday, he assured them that, just as democracy eventually triumphed over dictatorship, prosperity would triumph over poverty, peace would triumph over violence, compassion would triumph over hatred, and good would triumph over evil. Tinubu is also optimistic that, following a difficult period for the country, justice, security, and economic development will visit and reside in every hamlet, household, village, and city. He went on to say that the spirit of June 12 would evolve into the spirit of Nigeria and the people’s national greatness and destiny.
