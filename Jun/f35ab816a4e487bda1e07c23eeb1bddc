President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) have been asked by a coalition of pro-democracy and civil society groups to choose Boss Mustapha, the secretary to the federal government, as the party’s vice-presidential candidate. This was stated in a statement signed by Isa Pai, Chukwudi Emmanuel, and Fola Akin on Wednesday. Mustapha will be a good choice for the party, according to the coalition, which includes the Peoples Alliance for Indigenous Rights (PAIR), Civil Society Action for National Inclusion (CSANI), and Society for Equity and Gender Advocacy (SEGA). “Mr. Boss Mustapha is near-impeccable, reliable, trustworthy and without controversy or any baggage to underwhelm the APC project to retain power in 2023,” the statement reads.

It is no small measure that he brilliantly coordinated the COVID-19 task team that performed creditably.”
