None of our members were invited. We have a secretariat but we never got any invitation from them,” he said. “The problem we have with this government, especially with the minister of labour, is that if you can tell the world that you have fixed a meeting which you didn’t, how do you expect us to believe other things you have said? “He should confirm to the world that he sent an invitation to ASUU for a meeting on Thursday. “The minister of labour should leave us to deal with the minister of education.
