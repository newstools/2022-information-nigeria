Tinubu, however, noted that he obtained a degree in business and administration in 1979 at the Chicago State University. Reacting in a tweet on Saturday, former Kaduna Central Senator, Shehu Sani, said the matter should be left alone if Tinubu can’t find his certificates as claimed. “Jagaban built many primary and secondary schools; if you can’t find the one he attended, you can find the ones he built and leave the matter, abeg,” he tweeted.
