 Nigerian singer, Timi Dakolo, has slammed the All Progressives Congress for using his song without his permission. Timi Dakolo’s hit song, ‘Great Nation’ was played at a point during the presidential primaries of the ruling party on Tuesday night. Displeased with the act, Timi Dakolo in a post on Twitter questioned why APC would use his song in a rally or campaign without his permission. Timi Dakolo noted that this is the second time APC would be doing such a thing, adding that it’s one of those things that people do and get away with in Nigeria. He wrote: “Why Use an Artist Song without their permission in a rally or campaign.The things people get away with in this Country called Nigeria. Actually this is the second time” Timi Dakolo’s tweet stirred mixed reactions from some Nigerians: @segalink wrote: “My brother @timidakolo I hope them don pay us for this song wey them dey play for APC convention so?” @deehumorous wrote: “Ambassadors for Change… You know u can just pay Timi Dakolo to coman perform ot with his real face and voice” @roqzee wrote: “Timi Dakolo talked about copyright licensing & ignorant people went in the comments insulting him & saying that songs in a public domain suddenly are free for use & belong to nobody. I hope your employers are not online, it’s good to keep quiet sometimes to hide your ignorance” @DemolaRewaju wrote: “Shey Timi Dakolo won’t sue these people like this.
