He added, “The security agents, who have been engaged to combat criminality and insecurity, are enjoined to heed the Qur’anic call that: ‘…For had it not been that God checks one set of people by means of another; monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, wherein the name of God is persistently mentioned would surely have been pulled down. Verily, God will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, God is All-Strong, All-Mighty. (Q 22: 40)’” The Sultan said that it is therefore mandatory for security agencies to help in rescuing the helpless citizens that everyone have all become.
