The children, whose mother, Lorita Azibato, lived at 2, Gbamire Street, were said to have wandered inside the complex where the vehicle was parked while playing. Visitors who arrived to see the car owner discovered the children, according to Nations. “Neighbours did not have her telephone number and so, the police had to wait until she returned home around 11:30pm to break the news to her” “Apparently, the children were not in the care of anyone else, the person in charge of them would have looked for them before their mother returned from the market” Confirming the incident, police spokesman,  Benjamin Hundeyin, said operatives attached to Owode Onirin received information around 7pm on Thursday that the young siblings were found inside the car lifeless. He said detectives immediately went to the scene, secured it for investigation and evacuated the bodies to the mortuary.
