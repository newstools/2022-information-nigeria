Samuel Ortom, Governor of Benue State, has told the international community that the Federal Government is unwilling to use the big stick against murderous terrorist groups. He urged the international community to put pressure on the Federal Government to address the country’s ongoing terrorism by armed herdsmen without regard for religion or ethnicity. Ortom made the appeal during an interaction with a delegation from the United Kingdom Parliament’s All Party Parliamentary Group on Freedom of Religion and Beliefs at the Benue State Governor’s Lodge, Asokoro, Abuja, according to a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Nathaniel Ikyur. The statement read in part, “The Governor stated that being a multi-religious and (multi-)ethnic country, the Federal Government, which is saddled with the responsibility of ensuring that the rights of the people as enshrined in the constitution are protected, ought to take the task more seriously than it is currently doing.
