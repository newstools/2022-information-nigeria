The Coalition for Peace and Progress, a political organization, asserts that Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, who is standing for president, should be paired with former House Speaker Yakubu Dogara. The group asserted that Dogara possesses the qualifications and political experience needed to join the ticket and would advance national cohesion. The coalition’s national coordinator, Muhammad Chindo, spoke on Saturday in Kaduna at a news conference. “Above all, it is imperative that the future vice-president must be a Christian who could transcend primordial sentiments bordering on religion and the twin evils of tribalism and sectionalism in the country, which Dogara is most appropriate,” he said. “After a thorough, painstaking search and our avowed commitment and dedication to the noble cause of ensuring a united Nigeria, we unanimously conclude the most suitable to hold the position of the vice-president under the APC is Yakubu Dogara.
