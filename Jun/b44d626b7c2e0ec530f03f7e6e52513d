I still had my life but I was so devastated that I didn’t know how to move on…I didn’t think life was important at the time. “JUNE 25, 2015…. I contemplated suicide in some moments… Felt there was nothing left to live for… The premiere of our series “DOGOOD” was days away and @africamagic, then @wangistar was the head said, you don’t have to show up, we will understand ” but something inside of me said ” you are not staying down, you will go. “They got me a Stylist to dress me & make up was @lolamaja. I remember the Stylist telling me I couldn’t go to the premiere with my hair like this, that I should expect backlash & criticism from the press. “Not one to be intimidated, I insisted on going like this….No one will tell me how to show up anywhere for an event that celebrated my craft. “I kept reading the book of Job in my bible all through the time I was homeless. It sort of comforted me…but I was angry with God and this was a real feeling. “I just had to be strong and know that He had better ahead for me. He sent me help from so many unexpected sources”
