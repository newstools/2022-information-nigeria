Femi Fani-Kayode, ex-minister of aviation under former President Olusegun Obasanjo, has mocked the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant and national leader of the party, Ahmed Bola Tinubu, over Tinubu’s outburst in Ogun State on Thursday. Posting the picture of the former Lagos State governor on his verified Facebook page, Kayode wrote that only God has the power over what one can become, and that it is a confrontation to God for one to brag over “making” another person.
