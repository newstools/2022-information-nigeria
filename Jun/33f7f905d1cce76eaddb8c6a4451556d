He is my brother. We are very close; that’s my own. And whenever he says something wrong, I pray over it. If he says something right, I pray over it. So, mine is prayers and whatever he does, I love him. This is me because he is a priest of God. ‘”I don’t have any problem with him. Whatever he says, I put it in prayers. If he says I’m not going to be voted because I don’t have money, my prayer is may God make these people who are collecting money to vote to see reasons why they should not do so. That’s prayers. “In fact, I had travelled when he said that. If I was there, I would have told him ‘since you’ve seen this, pray for me to overcome it’. That’s what I tell to every pastor. I meet pastors everyday who tell me ‘Peter, this is what is going to happen’. And I tell them ‘since you’ve seen it, let’s pray that it doesn’t happen’.”
