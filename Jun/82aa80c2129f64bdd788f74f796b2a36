The board agreed to retroactively condone candidates who were offered secret admission by some tertiary institutions from 2017 to 2021 sequel to the noble intervention of the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu,” he added. He, therefore, urged concerned institutions to desist from such practices and comply with the board’s directives that all admissions must be conducted through CAPS.
