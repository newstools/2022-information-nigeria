Omoyele Sowore, the African Action Congress’ presidential candidate, accused the ruling All Progressives Congress of monetising the just-concluded governorship election in Ekiti State on Sunday. Recall that the APC’s candidate, Biodun Oyebanji, won the governorship election in 15 of the state’s 16 Local Government Areas. He received 187,057 votes, beating out his opponents Olabisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party and Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party, who received 67,457 and 82,211 votes, respectively. Meanwhile, the human rights activist described the exercise as “unfair and corrupt” on Twitter.
