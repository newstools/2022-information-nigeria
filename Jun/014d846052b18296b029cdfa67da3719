I still get so much joy just loving you and wanting to do this life with you. “I pray that the God I serve will continually see us through all the years of our marriage because we made him our firm foundation. I do not and will never take the grace of God in this marriage for granted. “Thank you for making it easier for me to love you. I know sometimes you get me upset but then again, we still have our way of sorting it all out without shouting and getting at each other’s throat. That is grace! Today, I reaffirm my love for you and my intention to carry on loving you, faults and all. May God continue to give me the grace to keep loving you and being your help meet.”
