Reno Omokri, an ex-media aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, has backed President Muhammadu Buhari in his decision to select the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate ahead of the 2023 general elections. Omokri also claimed that supporters of APC National Leader and presidential aspirant Bola Tinubu are murmuring that Buhari should not choose the APC’s presidential candidate. On Wednesday afternoon, he tweeted this via his Twitter handle.

Buhari made the announcement during a meeting with governors yesterday at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. “I don’t understand why Bola Tinubu’s people are murmuring that Buhari shouldn’t choose who APC’s presidential candidate will be,” Omokri tweeted. “Who chooses who becomes a candidate of the APC in Lagos? Is it not solely Tinubu? What is good for Lagos APC is also good for national APC!”
