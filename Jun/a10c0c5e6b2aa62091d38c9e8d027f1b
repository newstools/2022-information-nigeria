Obasanjo spoke on Saturday during a leadership mentoring session with selected students in Abeokuta, Ogun state. He however said God saved him from the mistake because it was a “genuine” one.

For instance, one of the mistakes I made was picking a number two when I was going to become president. But because it is a genuine mistake, God saved me out of it,” the former president said. “Some people thought it was a mistake for me to go into the army. It could have been a mistake or when Abacha wanted to arrest me, I was told by the American ambassador that they will arrest me and that America has asked I should be given asylum. I said, no. “It could have been a mistake because I could have lost my life. So I will say, many things that could have been a mistake but God saved me from them all.”
