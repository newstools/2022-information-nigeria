According to Mr Babachir Lawal, the country’s consideration of a Muslim president and a Muslim vice president in 2023 is dead on arrival. Lawal, a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), stated this on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Thursday. He believes that considering such a thought is inappropriate given the peculiarities of the nation’s political atmosphere, which is divided along regional and religious lines.

On the contrary, it has worsened,” he added.
