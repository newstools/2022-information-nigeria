 The sixth episode of Big Brother Naija Reunion, which provided insight into what led to the end of the most admired ship in season 6 of the reality TV show, has continued to elicit reactions from a wide range of people. The revelation that EmmaRose’s ship sailed a long time ago is particularly noteworthy. The episode began with Ebuka Obi-Uchendu showing the housemates a video of Emmanuel and Angel in what appeared to be a flirtatious moment. Moving on to Liquorose and Emmanuel, Liquorose spilled the beans while also describing how she walked in on Emmanuel with a girl in a room while the lights were turned off. Tacha, a Big Brother Naija 4 housemate, quickly chimed in with her thoughts. In multiple tweets, she wrote: “Never let a confused man waste your time or energy.. What you allow is what will CONTINUE!! “Fear Men!! Linus Linus Linus. Welcome back to the streets Bby Girl. It’ll be Alright. “Pure LIES!! Shhs already. His loss baby Girl… Don’t sweat.”
