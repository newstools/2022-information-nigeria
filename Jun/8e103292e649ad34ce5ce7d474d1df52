Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has congratulated Biodun Oyebanji, the APC’s candidate in the Ekiti State governorship election and the Governor-elect, on his landslide victory in Saturday’s poll. The Governor stated the enormous gap of votes between the Ekiti governor-elect and his co-contestants “clearly indicates the trust and confidence of Nigerians across the country in the APC,” according to a statement released by the Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba. Ganduje congratulated the APC on a peaceful and successful election, both at the state and national levels, and praised the people of Ekiti State for making the right choice.

He, therefore, urged the governor-elect to be benevolent in victory by carrying all the people in the state along for continued good governance. The governor praised the Independent National Electoral Commission for a job well done and security agencies for ensuring a peaceful election in the state.
