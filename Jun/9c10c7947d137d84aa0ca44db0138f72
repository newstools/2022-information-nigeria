The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), which is currently on strike, has stated that it is awaiting the Federal Government’s response to its demands. The Federal Government’s renegotiation committee, led by Prof. Nimi Briggs, met with ASUU leadership on Monday to continue renegotiation of the FGN-ASUU 2009 agreements with the four university unions, all of which are currently on strike. The meeting was fair, according to ASUU President Emmanuel Osodek. He also added that they were expecting the government to respond to the issues they discussed with the committee.
