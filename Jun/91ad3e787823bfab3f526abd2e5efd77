 Former Big Brother Naija ‘Shine Ya Eye’ Housemate Tega Dominic has knocked a troll as she reveals what would have been Boma’s fate if they had sex. Tega, while defending the illicit affair with Boma during the reunion show said she used marriage as a strategy on the show. Speaking of her affair with Boma, Tega said, “To me, everything that was going on between me and Boma was all a cruise.” Reacting, Boma said Tega had earlier told him her marriage had ended, so to him, he was dealing with a single woman.  Tega who seemed there was no need for more explanation on the issue said Boma would not have left her ‘Bum Bum’ if they had s3x.
