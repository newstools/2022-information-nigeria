Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has congratulated former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, on his victory at the All Progressives Congress presidential primary election. The governor in a congratulatory message personally signed by him on Wednesday stated that the emergence of Tinubu as flagbearer of the APC in the 2023 general election would be a victory for the Nigeria project. He stated that the Jagaban “has the capacity to provide the needed leadership that would consolidate and continue to ensure the country’s democratic gains.” Ganduje commended President Muhammadu Buhari, for providing the enabling environment that produced the standard flagbearer, the National Working Committee, the delegates and all other organ and structures of the party across the federation for the collective efforts in ensuring the success of the convention.
