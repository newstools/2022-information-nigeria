A new post shared on the microblogging platform, Twitter, shows that Burna Boy is still unremorseful about the incident. According to Burna Boy, with the consistent speculations peddled about him online, he will not be surprised if Nigerians on social media claim he started Boko Haram. He wrote: “Nigerian Social media can say BURNA BOY started Boko haram, e no go shock me.” Where he was seated, the singer who was already with three women reportedly spotted another woman and immediately sent for her. Burna Boy according to reports, summoned Inspector Ibrahim, the officer with him in the VIP section and told him to invite the woman to come to join him. However, the lady snubbed the invite as her husband who was said to be present, lambasted Burna Boy, insisting that it was disrespectful for any man to make advances on his wife. A few minutes later, Burna Boy reportedly made fresh advances towards the woman and the development stirred commotion. This infuriated her husband further and his friends who had gathered at the club and the matter soon degenerated. The altercation between Burna Boy and the lady’s husband resulted in shooting my the singer’s security escort.
