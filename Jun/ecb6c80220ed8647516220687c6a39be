The commissioner insulted the applicant who was seeking clarification about the teacher’s recruitment exercise held last Saturday in the state. In a voice note which has gone rival, the commissioner slammed the applicant and her colleagues for their behaviour during the recruitment exercise. Chuma-Udeh described the female applicant as a hooligan and idiot who should not dream to be a teacher or be in the education sector. She said: “Madam, you’re an idiot. You mean the computers are doing what? I received a report by 12 noon that you people refused to stand in line, you refused to be identified; you mobbed.  “Get out of my phone you filthy thing. Do you really want to be a teacher? How will you tell your students to conform to instructions, when you cannot stand in line and move line in line, and you want to be a teacher when you are behaving like hooligans. “I have nothing for you and I have nothing to say to you. We have already examined up to 1,400 candidates and …you are all hooligans. I hope you understand me. Thank you.”
