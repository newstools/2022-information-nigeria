 Nollywood actor Yul Edochie has been mocked online after his daughter spoke disrespectfully to him in a social media post. As the marriage of Yul Edochie to his colleague Judy Austin continue to generate reactions online, his daughter in a post on Instagram issued a warning to those linking him to her father’s marriage brouhaha. She refuted the claims of being an actress or having any business with Nollywood stating that people should not force any career on her. She added that she doesn’t act in movies nor is interested in acting and warned people to stop tagging her on posts related to Yul Edochie. She wrote: “Please I’m not an actress, I have no business with acting and Nollywood, No day force carer on me Abeg. I don’t act and I’m not interested in acting. Acting is for him, not me and I am a whole different person. I am on my own identity. Please stop taking me in a post related to him, Nollywood, films, and actors. I am not interested in Nollywood”  See some of the reactions below. bet_herbalsecret wrote: “See how he lose respect in front of his daughter.
