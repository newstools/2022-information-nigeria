The Social Democratic Party (SDP) says its gubernatorial candidate of Ekiti, Segun Oni, is still running. The rebuttal comes after a statement attributed to Oni claimed that he had withdrawn from the election owing to the illegality of the party’s national working committee (NWC). However, when TheCable contacted Gani Salau, the party’s Ekiti spokesperson, he stated that Oni has not withdrawn from the race and that the letter is “a figment of the opposition’s imagination.” Also Read: I’ve Never Failed In Elections, Tinubu Boasts In Ekiti “Segun Oni is not withdrawing.
