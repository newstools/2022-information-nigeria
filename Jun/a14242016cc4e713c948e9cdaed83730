Recall that Tiwa Savage got the social media agog with mixed reactions after a sultry video of her surfaced online. In a post shared on Instagram, Uche Maduagwu questioned Tiwa Savage if such an appearance can get her a man stating it could be the reason she was dumped by her ex-husband, Teebillz.

She wrote: “So this is how Aunty WA Dey look for Somebody Son to find AM some day? Now I see why Uncle T Waka leave you. What exactly is the moral lesson this outfit is suppose to Educate our Pikins?
