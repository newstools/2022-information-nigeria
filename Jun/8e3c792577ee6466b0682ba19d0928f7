A delegation of northern leaders, including Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State and Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano, has been assigned to meet with the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, over ‘vital concerns’ regarding his proposed running mate. The development comes just 24 hours after Ibrahim Shekarau, the two-term governor of Kano State and senator from the Kano Central Senatorial District, defected. Shekarau left the All Progressive Party in May to support Dr. Rabiu Kwankwaso, the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, and his defection was confirmed by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, during the session on Wednesday. The negotiation’s dynamics have shifted as a result of Shekarau’s defection and the Labour Party’s Peter Obi’s proposed partnership with the NNPP, a party chieftain told PUNCH NG.
