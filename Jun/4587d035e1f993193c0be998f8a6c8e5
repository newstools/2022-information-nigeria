Before selecting a running mate for the 2023 presidential election, Bola Tinubu should consult the ‘Noble Dozen,’ according to the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC). Tinubu was elected flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress, APC, after winning the party’s presidential primaries on Wednesday at Eagles Square in Abuja. The Islamic group explained that the ‘Noble Dozen’ refers to the twelve Northern governors who insisted on giving the South the opportunity to produce President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor.

This was a great sacrifice and a noble idea. “They demonstrated statesmanship, patriotism and nobility of thought by that action.“
