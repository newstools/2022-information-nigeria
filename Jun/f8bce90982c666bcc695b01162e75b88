Chief Segun Oni, a former governor and candidate for the Social Democratic Party (SDP), has rejected the results of Saturday’s governorship election, saying the outcome would be challenged in court. Oni, speaking through his state collation agent and former state attorney-general, Owoseni Ajayi, said the results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) did not reflect the true will of the people, and that the process had been tainted by bribes.
