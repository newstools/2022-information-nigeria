 Former Big Brother Naija ‘LockDown’ Housemate, Tolani Baj got more than she bargained for after sharing what many perceived to be an insensitive post on Twitter. Since the news of the gruesome killing of some Catholic members broke online, Nigerians have been thrown into a state of mourning as netizens and celebrities took to their social media pages to mourn the victims. However, Tolani Baj ignored the tragic incident and took to her Twitter page to announce the release of her new vlog. She tweeted: “A new vlog is dropping shortly” The tweet didn’t sit well with many Nigerians as they dragged her for snubbing the killing at Ondo state and not condemning the attack. @30bgfidi wrote: “@tolanibaj Ogun kill you and your vlog” @nosafk wrote: “@tolanibaj This is not the right time though.
