Festus Keyamo, Minister of State for Labour and Employment, has stated that reports of vote-buying in the just-concluded governorship election in Ekiti State are not exclusive to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Keyamo’s statement follows reports that the APC was involved in widespread vote-buying and selling in the ongoing Ekiti elections.
