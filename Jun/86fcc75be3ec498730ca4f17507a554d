Since then, Emeka Ike’s life has never been the same and he took a break from Nollywood. In a post shared on Instagram, Emeka Ike said research has proven that most women abuse men lately as they don’t love. Emeka Ike who claimed he was a victim of abuse said most women marry for money and make the life of their husbands miserable. According to the actor, there are still deadbeat fathers but there’s an increase in how men are manipulated which is totally ignored.

Most of them they marry you for your money and make ur life miserable, If not kill u. I was a victim, why are kidnappers and armed robbers wives not crying out?
