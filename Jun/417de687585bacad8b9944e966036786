Nigerians have slammed the All Progressives Congress, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu following a throwback photo of Nigeria’s Vice president, Yemi Osinbajoin primary school. This comes shortly after it was reported Tinubu claimed that his school certificates were stolen by unknown persons during the military rule in 1990. The former governor of Lagos State stated this in an affidavit submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as part of his eligibility filings for the 2023 presidential elections. Following Tinubu’s primary school certificate saga, social media users dug up a throwback photo of young Professor Yemi Osinbajo and his classmates at Corona Primary School, Ikoyi Lagos.  They further slammed the national leader of his inability to provide a photo of himself in primary school to prove his claims are true.
