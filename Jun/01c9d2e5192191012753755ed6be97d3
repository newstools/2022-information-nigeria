Dr. Paul Enenche, Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, has stated that Nigeria has reached a point where urgent and fervent prayers for divine intervention are required. According to him, there is a need for God’s intervention across the country because of insecurity. Pastor Enenche made the announcement on Thursday, ahead of the National Healing and Deliverance Crusade, during the daily ‘Early Will I Seek Thee’ morning prayers. According to the cleric, the three-day crusade, dubbed Divine Visitation, is being held to seek God’s intervention for Nigeria, particularly as the country prepares for general elections in 2023. He said, “Our nation is at a junction where divine intervention is absolutely necessary. Massive insecurity, massive instability. And then, we are at the threshold of a political process.

The Bible says if my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear them and heal their land. “I believe that as God heals individual and delivers individuals, he would heal the nation as well. “Therefore, I will like to invite you this evening to the FCT Sports Complex and the Old Parade Ground at Area 10 Abuja as we intercede for our nation.”
