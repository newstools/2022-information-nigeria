I am excited about what is to come but why do I feel so afraid. “I guess it kind of mirrored my life. I don’t welcome change as I should, I hold on to things cos I’m afraid I not what I might find after, I’m afraid or the me that I’ll have to learn again cos I’ve worked so hard to become who I am, I’m scared of losing me again.

I can’t wait to share with you all and I hope you come on this journey with me. Coming soon”
