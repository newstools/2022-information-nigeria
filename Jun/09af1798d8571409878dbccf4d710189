Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate for the Peoples Democratic Party, declared on Thursday that steps were being made to unify the party and soothe all irate members in the wake of the controversy surrounding the selection of his running mate. Following Wednesday’s outburst by Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom, who said that Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and others who supported Wike for the PDP vice-presidential nomination deserved a thorough justification from Atiku, the former presidential candidate gave his assurance. This was at the same time that he claimed to have turned to fast and prayer in order to seek God’s guidance following the selection of Ifeanyi Okowa, the governor of Delta State, as Atiku’s running mate instead of Wike.
