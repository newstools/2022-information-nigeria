Former president Goodluck Jonathan has stated that he did not have enough time to implement the report of the 2014 national conference. He made the comment at the public presentation of a book ‘The National Question’ authored by Akpandem James and Sam Akpe on Tuesday. Jonathan was represented at the event by former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim. Whenever people say that I should have implemented its recommendations, my feeling is either those people did not understand the political environment at that time, the length of time it would take to implement the report of a conference like that or probably were just playing politics with such an important matter,” Jonathan said. “Those knowledgeable about the processes of constitutional reforms will know that to implement the Confab report, a number of alterations will be
made in the constitution which would require the involvement of the National Assembly and state assemblies.
