Bamisile, who represents Gbonyin/Ekiti East/Emure Federal Constituency, also predicted an APC landslide victory in Ekiti State’s governorship election on June 18. Bamisile spoke at the weekend in Omuo Ekiti, Ekiti East LGA, while distributing cars, motorcycles, dryers, and other materials worth over N300 million to his constituents. The lawmaker said Tinubu’s ability to overcome obstacles to become the APC’s presidential candidate demonstrated his political savvy, noting that the PDP could not prevent the former Lagos governor from realizing his ambition.
