Yahaya Bello, Governor of Kogi State, and Hafsat Abiola-Costello, Director-General of his Presidential Campaign Organization, led various groups of Nigerian women on Saturday to commemorate late Chief Moshood Kashimawo Abiola’s June 12 Democracy Day. Bello, a presidential hopeful in the All Progressives Congress’s recently concluded primaries, said the event was held to keep MKO’s hope and vision alive. The governor expressed his delight that MKO Abiola’s vision had survived nearly 30 years, citing it as one of the reasons he was determined to run for President in 2023. Bello said, “I was in the secondary school in 1993 when the struggle began and almost 30 years after, we are here to bear the torchlight of that struggle and hence my decision, your decision for Yahaya Bello to venture so that this hope can be rekindled.
