Kayode Fayemi, the governor of Ekiti and a presidential hopeful, says he has not abandoned his campaign for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. After a closed-door meeting, the Fayemi campaign organization said this in response to claims that he was pressured into dropping his presidential bid for vice president. The insinuation was described as “absolute rubbish” by Femi Ige, a spokesman for the campaign organization, in a statement released on Friday.
