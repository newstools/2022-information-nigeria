He further emphasized that many of the memes and phrases about his mother that are spreading online have been altered. In spite of her many provocative words and deeds, Samuel claimed in an interview with PUNCH that his mother has never coerced individuals or her followers to believe her. He asked social media users not to take his mother’s words personally and to disregard or accept any of her teachings that fit their religious beliefs. Samuel said, “Social media has always been a platform where anything can be posted at any point in time but everything that has been posted about her saying she said this and that are all lies, nothing is true about the memes, they are just fabricating the memes, everybody with their contents, writing all sorts of things and tagging her pictures. We are used to it; the best thing is to ignore them. “Even though she said everything about hell, there is nowhere she said by fire, by force, people must agree and accept what she is saying. I don’t think she has ever made that kind of statement before.
