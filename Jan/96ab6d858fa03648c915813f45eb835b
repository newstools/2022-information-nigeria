Speaker of the house of representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila has stated that there is a need to amend the constitution to increase the educational qualification for election into the office of the president. Gbajabiamila also wants the academic qualification of other elective offices including the legislature to be raised from the current minimum requirement. Section 131 (d) of the 1999 constitution states that “A person shall be qualified for election to the office of the President if he has been educated up to at least School Certificate level or its equivalent”. The speaker spoke at the University of Lagos’ convocation on Monday.

It will be another step in reforming our electoral system and providing strong leadership for the country.”
