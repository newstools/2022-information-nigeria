If Christians want to have a constructive impact on society, Bayelsa State Governor Douye Diri has recommended they actively participate in politics and stop considering it as dirty. On Thursday, Diri provided the advice at the conclusion of a two-day event organized by the Redeemed Christian Church of God in Yenagoa dubbed “Light Up Bayelsa Holy Ghost Rally.” He exhorted Christians not to stay out of politics or to be apathetic about it, but to join in order to influence decision-making for the greater good of the people.
