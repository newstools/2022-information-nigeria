Former military head of state Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB) claims that former military dictator Sani Abacha deceived “prominent Nigerians” to gain power. Babangida claimed in 2021 that he cancelled the election because a deadly coup would have taken place if he had not. Babaginda said Abacha deceived Nigerians by pledging to return the country to civilian governance after deposing Shonekan in an interview with Daily Trust TV. “Abacha’s government was very smart. They knew who were the most vociferous discussants about the election, about the coup, about June 12 and so on,” Babangida said.

Next thing is going to be a democratically-elected government’. I knew, we knew, that it wouldn’t be because the argument was: ‘Why should I risk my life only to come and hand over power to you?’ That was what happened.” “I knew it will not come as a surprise because even though I was outside – outside the service – I knew what was going on.”
