The union is happening five years after her marriage to Gentry crashed in 2017 on allegations of domestic violence on Gentry’s part and infidelity on her own part. Gentry has however since remarried. This means that Mercy and her ex husband, Gentry were family friends to Adeoti and his wife, Funsho. Reacting to Mercy’s new found love, Gentry who was Mercy’s second husband said, “At last. I thank God the truth is out. This is just one out of the many. To God be all the glory.” Gentry in his reaction is trying to justify his earlier claim that while married to Mercy, she was in the habit of having affairs with other men, an action that led to the collapse of the marriage. Mercy and Gentry’s marriage produced a son, Olajuwon before it packed up. See post below:    A post shared by MERCY AIGBE (@realmercyaigbe)
