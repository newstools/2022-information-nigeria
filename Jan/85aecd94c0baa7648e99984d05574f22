Due to a scarcity of lecturers, the National Universities Commission (NUC) has recommended that universities be excluded from the Federal Government’s circular on new employment. According to the commission, Nigerian universities have 100,000 academic staff members serving 2.1 million students. This was revealed in the NUC’s most recent report, which was made available to newsmen. Mr Chris Maiyaki, the NUC’s Deputy Executive Secretary for Administration, was reported in the bulletin as saying that the commission oversees nearly 200 universities, with 48 belonging to the federal government, 54 states, and 99 private institutions.
