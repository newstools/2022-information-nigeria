Former President Goodluck Jonathan would face opposition from the Igbo spirit if he fails to support the election of an Igbo president in 2023, according to the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization Ohanaeze Ndigbo. Ohanaeze Ndigbo National Publicity Secretary, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, stated that the suffering Ndigbo were going through under President Muhammadu Buhari was due to the support Igbo provided Jonathan. Jonathan allegedly met with South-South leaders on December 27 to coordinate his purported intention to run for president in 2023.

He should realise it. That is the Ohanaeze Ndigbo position and by extension Igbo position.”
