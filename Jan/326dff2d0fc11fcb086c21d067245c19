Despite the Federal Government’s announcement that it would not remove the fuel subsidy, for the time being, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has pledged to hold its planned nationwide march on Thursday. During an interview on Channels Television’s breakfast show Sunrise Daily, NLC Deputy President Joe Ajaero noted that the rally is intended at sensitizing Nigerians. “NLC is still standing on its position,” he said on Tuesday. “The Federal Government didn’t say they have abolished it, they are postponing the evil day.

On the 27th of January 2022, we rally nationwide, including the FCT,” he added.
