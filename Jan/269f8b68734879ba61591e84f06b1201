The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) opposes the federal government’s plans to raise taxes on non-alcoholic and carbonated beverages. The position of the NLC is outlined in a statement signed by its President, Mr. Ayuba Wabba, and released to journalists in Abuja. The additional taxes were proposed by the government as a means of deterring sugar overconsumption, combating obesity, and raising funds for the 2022 budget.

As a result, the NLC has asked the National Assembly to alter the portions of the Finance Act that reintroduced excise levies on non-alcoholic and carbonated beverages as soon as possible.
