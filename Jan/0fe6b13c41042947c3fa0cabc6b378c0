On January 10, primary, secondary, and government science and technical colleges in Ogun State will resume. The Ogun State Government had previously set January 4 as the day for schools to resume. The administration, however, announced a change in the date in a press release made in December 2021. Before resuming, learners and parents must sign an undertaking to abide by the rules, according to Prof. Abayomi Arigbabu, the State Commissioner for Education, Science, and Technology.
