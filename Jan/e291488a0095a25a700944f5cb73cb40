National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, has stated that poor leadership has presented Nigeria at home and abroad as an extremely divided country. He stated that the leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress has been unable to harness the rich diversity of Nigerians into better fortunes that should strengthen the bond of brotherhood and promote peaceful coexistence. He maintained that the current inept rule of the APC-led Federal Government, which he said has pulled the country backward economically, has to be changed. Ayu stated that the only way for this to happen is for the PDP to be supported in its determination to produce the next leadership in the country.
