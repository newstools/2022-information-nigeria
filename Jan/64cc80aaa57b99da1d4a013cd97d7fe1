 Stan Nze and wife, Blessing Obasi Nigerian actor, Stan Nze, has disclosed that the high rate of celebrity breakups made him question his readiness for marriage. The 32-year-old revealed this in an interview with media personality, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, in Rubbin’ Minds show, which aired on Sunday. The Rattlesnake star had married a fellow Nollywood star, Blessing Obasi, aged 42, in September 2021, a period that witnessed breakups and marriage crises involving celebrities like Tonto Dikeh, 2Baba, etc. According to the actor, he had planned to keep his marriage under wraps till his honeymoon. He said, “I’ve always wanted my family to be private. My marriage was to be under wraps until my honeymoon but my wife insisted we post a photo so we control any coming narrative. We’d been together for 3 and a half years,” he said.

“I want my marriage to work. A week before my marriage, I left social media. There was a lot of news on Instagram. Partners were fighting each other. I was literally palpitating, asking myself if I was ready for marriage. “These were people I felt they were really in love, some even having dated for seven years. It was important that I married someone in the entertainment industry, whether radio, film, or movies. It’s a delicate industry.”
