You can’t be cheating and still ministering. Even if you have repented. Leave the ministry and go and ask youself why you were cheating. Find the foundation of your relationship with God before you lead others,” “When you cheat and you are in a moral position you must step away from Minstry! You have to. And also it’s soo important to hold yourself accountable and confess. When something is in the dark let it comes to the light so that there is healing!” See tweet below:
