Having a large “liquid” cash pile means that you have a chance to take any opportunity as soon as it becomes available. However, don’t fall into the temptation of bank interest!

The most notable names in the startups crowdfunding space include:
· Wefunder

In times of uncertainty and high inflation levels, investors resort to gold as it has a nearly fixed price which depends on its scarcity and difficulty of extraction. In addition, it is widely available in all countries of the world and has a solid non-wavering demand from regular folks, investors, banks, and many other parties.
The gold coin was the local and international trade currency in ancient times. Then, in 1958, the Bretton Woods system alternated gold with U.S. Dollar and placed the gold standard for U.S. Dollar in which $35 was convertible to 1 gold ounce to rebuild the international economic system. However, in 1971, Richard Nexon announced that the U.S. ended dollar convertibility to gold, and the government would no longer convert dollars to gold at a fixed price. As a result, all world currencies fluctuate in relation to the dollar and their prices against the dollar change daily! But, on the other hand, gold is still a safe haven. It stores the value of your savings and maintains its purchasing power for thousands of years!
