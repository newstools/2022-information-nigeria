Nigerians should be wary of illicit money lenders, sometimes known as loan sharks, according to Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This was said by Emefiele at the end of the monetary policy committee meeting in Abuja on Tuesday. Loan sharks offer loans with excessively high interest rates, severe collection terms if the borrower defaults, and often operate outside of the law. Those who seek loans from locations other than microfinance banks or recognized organizations, according to the CBN governor, are at greater risk. “There is no need for you to go to loan sharks for a loan. People normally go to loan sharks because they are desperate and can’t access the bank,” Emefiele said.

The central bank has put in place the avenue through which you can raise your finance, like through the target credit facility or the SMEs loan that was set up through our microfinance banks. “You don’t have to owe anybody, just go to the portal and fill the form, send your data, and if it’s correct, you will be able to access loans.”
