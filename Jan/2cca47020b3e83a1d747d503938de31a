Professor Charles Soludo, the Governor-Elect of Anambra State, has revealed why outgoing Governor Willie Obiano backed him during the 2021 governorship election. Soludo told a crowd in Obiano’s Aguleri country residence on Monday that the governor approved his governorship ambition five years ago without conditions. Obiano was certain in his support for him, according to Soludo, because he was the best of all the candidates who had expressed interest in Anambra’s top post.

I want to tell you publicly today that not one second was there any such.”
