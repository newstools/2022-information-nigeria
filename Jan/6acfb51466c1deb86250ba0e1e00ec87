   Iyabo Ojo took to her social media to reminisce on her journey to single motherhood. She said that she sometime got afraid, depressed and all that but has been able to pull through and now her kids are grown. The star shared a throwback photo of herself ad her kids recounting how it was when she got faced with the reality of her life by turning into a single mother with no direction which she probably didn’t imagine could happen to her. In her words, Iyabo was afraid, depressed, confused, and always had a lot of anxiety as she felt like a failure, a loser as she felt she wasn’t good enough to be a single mother and didn’t know how to fit in or even how to start or how she was going to pull through.
