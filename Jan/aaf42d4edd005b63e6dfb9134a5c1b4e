Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have asked the national assembly to override President Muhammadu Buhari and pass the electoral act amendment bill or remove the provisions on direct primary. The governors’ position is contained in a communique released on Monday after a meeting in Port Harcourt, capital of Rivers state. Recall that the president declined assent to the bill, citing concerns over the recommendation of direct primaries for political parties.

An early concluded Electoral Act is vital for credible elections.”
