Two factions inside the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Ekiti Political Intervention Coalition and Concerned Delegates and Party Members, have expressed dissatisfaction with the party’s primary election in the state. Former Ekiti PDP chairman Bisi Kolawole was elected as the party’s governorship candidate on Wednesday, defeating ex-governor Segun Oni and former deputy governor Kolapo Olusola. The groups stated in a statement on Friday that the party’s national leader, Iyorchia Ayu, should expect his first loss in the state governorship election because the process for selecting Kolawole was not transparent.
