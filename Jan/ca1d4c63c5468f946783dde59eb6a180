President Muhammadu Buhari has stated that he is looking forward to the end of his term because “age is catching up with him.” The president said this on Thursday in an interview on NTA. When asked how he feels now that he has turned 79, Buhari responded that being president is difficult job and that he is looking forward to the conclusion of his term in 2023. The president stated that he has faithfully served Nigeria as a minister, governor, and now president and that he believes that when his term ends, Nigerians will recognize that he has done his best for the country.

Really, it’s a lot of hard work, but as I’ve said, I asked for it and I cannot complain. “I have been a governor, I have been a minister, and I’m in my second term as president. So, I’ve gone through all the system and really, what else can I do for this country? I have given my best.”
