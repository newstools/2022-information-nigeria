 In Nigeria, the federal government has issued a gazette designating bandits as terrorists. A federal high court in Abuja ruled all bandit groups’ activities in the country to constitute acts of terrorism on November 25. Abubakar Malami, the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), said on Tuesday during a Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) show that the government is attempting to ensure that it runs within the boundaries of international best practices, adding that the gazette would be available in a few days. Malami’s spokesperson, Umar Gwandu, announced the publication of the gazette on Wednesday.
