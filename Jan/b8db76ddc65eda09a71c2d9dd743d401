This is because there cannot be meaningful development in any country where the grievances of workers, who are the drivers of development, are ignored. “In line with the principle and practice of collective bargaining, the government, particularly in recent times, has had to engage organised labour unions in constant dialogue. Thus, it is pleasing to note that such effort has not been in vain, as we can appreciate the evident harmonious industrial atmosphere in the country,” she partly said.
