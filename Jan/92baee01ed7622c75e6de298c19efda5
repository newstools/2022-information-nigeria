According to a report by The PUNCH, there was drama in the Ebonyi State High Court on Wednesday as the Publicity Secretary of the state Peoples Democratic Party, Chika Nwoba, collapsed outside the court premises as the police were about arraigning him. He was brought into the court premises by officers and men of the Ebonyi State Police Command at about 2:45 pm but the period of the Court sitting was shifted due to Nwoba’s health condition.
