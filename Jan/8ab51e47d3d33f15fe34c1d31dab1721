Anybody who wants my advice, I will always be there in the best interest of Nigeria. “Whatever I do in my own life…because I became president on the platform of PDP, PDP will continue to be part of my life. Since the day I tore my PDP card, that was the day I ceased to be a member of PDP. That day I vowed not to be a member of any political party. “I will continue to be a statesman.”
