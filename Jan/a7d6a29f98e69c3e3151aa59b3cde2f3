Beyond giving interest-free microcredit loans to petty traders, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) claims that the Buhari administration’s many social intervention initiatives have had a substantial impact on the lives of millions of ordinary Nigerians. According to Osinbajo, the government has increased support for the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector, which accounts for about half of Nigeria’s GDP and employs 76 percent of the country’s workforce. The vice president made this summation in his keynote address on Monday at the Bank of Industry (BOI) Aid for Productivity report launch – chronicling the development, impact, and future of the BOI’s Growth Platform – which is the human and technology infrastructure used to drive multiple large-scale intervention programmes for micro, small and medium enterprises.

This is an example of what we can achieve when we unleash the best of our people – especially our young – on the toughest of our challenges, and give them the free-hand to deliver results,” he added.
