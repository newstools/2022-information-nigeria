President Muhammadu Buhari’s efforts to reduce insecurity in Nigeria have been commended by Governor Ben Ayade of Cross Rivers State, who claims that the country would have crumbled if it weren’t for his efforts. On Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily on Wednesday, the governor stated this, saying that the President’s military history aided in this. He claims that there was an international plot against the country, notably in the north.

I think the situation could have been worse.” He noted that apart from addressing insecurity, the present government is also repositioning the economy, adding that there have been moves to tap into other sources of revenue.
