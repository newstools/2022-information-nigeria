 Victoria Ajeh Victoria Ajeh, the 11-year-old rape victim who gave birth to a baby boy in Makurdi, Benue state has been discharged from the hospital. The minor was allegedly raped and impregnated by her aunt’s husband, Joseph Adoyi, a guard with the Benue State University (BSU) who is said to be in his mid 50s. Andrew Obeya, a development specialist, who has been supporting the minor, shared the update on Saturday, January 22.

“Victoria Ajeh is back home to her reality. This picture breaks my heart: A baby begets her own baby. The baby in the background (on the bed by her side) is her younger sibling that was born on Christmas day,” he wrote.
