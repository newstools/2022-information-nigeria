On Friday, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) warned that unless God intervened, the country would become Sodom and Gomorrah. Despite the Federal Government’s pleas to the international community, the organization regretted that attention was focused on the COVID-19 pandemic rather than Nigeria. The President of CAN, Dr. Samson Ayokunle, said these in his New Year Message titled, ‘Pray for God’s mercy over Nigeria – CAN’.

Glory be to our God who helped us to escape all dangers and threats of 2021, occasioned by the criminal activities of bandits, terrorists, kidnappers and other unscrupulous elements amidst us. “2021 was one year too many as a result of the ways and manners these criminals have been operating with impunity as if this is not the country we have been all these years. It is as if they have taken over the country. They invade communities, markets, churches and schools. They kill, maim, destroy and kidnap without much resistance or hindrance. “At this juncture, I call on all Nigerians, irrespective of their religious affiliations, to rise up and cry for the mercy of God that can preserve us and bring an end to all these pains. It appears as if our governments have got to their wit’s end over the menace of insecurity. Their major focus now is on the 2023 general election. Can 2023 election happen if the nation is overrun by criminals?”
