 Interior decorator and socialite, Ehi Ogbebor has taken to Instagram to beg Benin indigenes over Bobrisky’s comment about their King which has generated controversy online. This is coming after Bobrisky issued a public apology after Benin people slammed him for asking the revered Oba of Benin to come and marry him. Bobrisky who is in Benin City for an event organized by interior designer Ehi Ogbebor, arrived yesterday and as he was being driven in a convoy, he made a video where he was showing his excitement for being in the city. While speaking, he hailed himself as a “pretty woman” and then mentioned that the Oba should come and marry him. This led to him being called out and being dragged by Edo indigenes.
