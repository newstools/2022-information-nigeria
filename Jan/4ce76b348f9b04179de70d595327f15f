Ten of the 11 members of the Olubadan-in-Council have endorsed the nomination of Dr Lekan Balogun as the next Olubadan of Ibadanland. The Council also denied that a legal tussle could scupper the succession to the Olubadan throne. The Osi Balogun of Ibadanland, High Chief Tajudeen Ajibola, stated these at a briefing by the kingmakers on Wednesday. He also debunks insinuations relating to the health and wellness of the new Olubadan-elect. He said all the negative media reports were nothing to worry about. The meeting is being attended by members of the Olubadan-in-Council, except former governor Rashidi Ladoja. Other High Chiefs in attendance are Balogun Olubadan, Owolabi Olakulehin; Otun Balogun, Olufemi Olaifa; Ashipa Olubadan, Eddy Oyewole and Osi Balogun, Tajudeen Ajibola. The new Olubadan-elect is expected to address the press at the meeting.
