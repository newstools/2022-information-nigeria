Marriage is honorable in God’s sight, squeezing the sleeping Olympus as if you no pay bride price.  it is shameful and repulsively preposterous, how do you want your father in-law to feel after seeing this video on social media, even if you paid 30 billion for her bride price, this is just so unacceptable, a man is the head of the home, Oga where is that in this? ” See post below:   A post shared by Africa Comedy King (@uchemaduagwu)
