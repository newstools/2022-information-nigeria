Kingsley Moghalu, a presidential candidate for the African Democratic Congress (ADC), tweeted about the 2023 presidential election on Wednesday. The former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) claimed he forgot to inform President Muhammadu Buhari of his plan to run for president. The tweet was apparently in response to All Progressives Congress (APC) leader Bola Tinubu and Ebonyi Governor Dave Umahi‘s visits to the State House.
