Alex Iwobi, the Nigerian footballer and Everton forward, will be unavailable for Nigeria when they take on Ghana for a place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. This is because of the red card he picked up during their 1-0 defeat to Tunisia. Iwobi, who came on as a substitute in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations round of 16 fixture, was sent off for a stamp. Senegalese referee, Maguette N’Diaye, had initially shown a yellow card for the foul. However, he was advised by Video Assistant Referee (VAR) to check the pitch-side monitor, after which he upgraded the yellow to a red. Iwobi is now suspended for the Super Eagles’ next fixtures on the continent, which is incidentally against the Black Stars. Nigeria are away in the first leg, before hosting their West African rivals in the return leg.
