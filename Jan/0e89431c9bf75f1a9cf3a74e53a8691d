An ex-presidential aide, Reno Omokri has warned Nigerians against electing Bola Tinubu, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress as the next president of Nigeria, describing him as ‘another London patient’. Omokri said this in a Facebook post on Friday after Tinubu left for London today. He questioned the recuperation trip by Tinubu to London, United Kingdom, wondering why he could not rest in Nigeria. In a post on his Facebook page, Reno cautioned Nigerians against electing the likes of President Muhammadu Buhari who would abandon the health sector in Nigeria to get medical attention from London. He said, “Tinubu says he has jetted out to London to “rest”. Dear citizens of Nigeria, are you not tired of Buhari running to London to rest? “Now you want to elect Tinubu, another London patient? Tinubu just returned from London three months ago. Now, he is back there. Think! “So, there is no place to rest in Nigeria? Obudu Cattle Ranch, Yankari Games Reserve, Ikogosi Warm Springs, Argungu Fishing Community, Olumo Rock, Gashska Gumption National Park, Mambilla Plateau, are all not good enough for Tinubu. It is only London he can rest? Haba! We were not born last night. “I did #HarassBuhariOutofLondon as my patriotic duty. It cost me money and time. Now, Tinubu has returned to London three months after he left. If you guys are foolish enough to elect another London patient in 2023, I will just enjoy myself and leave you all to your fate”!
