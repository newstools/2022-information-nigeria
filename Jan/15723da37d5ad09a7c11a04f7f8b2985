Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor has advised Nigerians to shun the use of camouflage for now, although it is not against the law for civilians to wear military gear. He stated that the present security situation does not allow the use of military gear by people who are not personnel of the DHQ. He gave the clarification on Friday during an interview on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily, in reaction to a question about the crackdown on the use of military gear by civilians.
