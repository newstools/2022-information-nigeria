Funmi said in full: “The last few months was tough for me but I’m grateful God gave my Mother another chance. At a point I lost my mind and I couldn’t find a better word to describe how I felt.. Seeing one’s mother going through so much pain can be frustrating. As if it wasn’t enough for a mother that lost her sight 👀 long time ago. Seeing her in so much pain made me sad and affected everything that surrounds me. It affected my career, I stopped going to location since last year July because I concentrated in taking care of her. It also affected my business cuz i keep going from one hospital to another🤦🏻‍♀️ Trust me, I turned down many Party invites, some of my colleagues think that I am proud or I don’t want to mingle not knowing that I have what I am battling with which is my MOTHER’S HEALTH. What is my Joy when my mother is in so much pain🥲 I so much love my family and I don’t joke with them but trust me the last few months has changed a lot about Me. Is it the money I spend daily? Or the “every 2hours drugs” Hmmm It is well.
I can’t complain, we can’t complain
I’m grateful to God she made it alive
My family is grateful God🙌
My only wish to God is to “PLEASE GIVE THIS WOMAN A CHANCE TO SEE AGAIN EVEN IF ITS JUST FOR 5MINS😩 JUST TO SEE WHAT HER DAUGHTER HAS BECOME.
Thanks to everyone that reach out!
2022, I’m ready for the good things you have for me and my family 🙏🏼“ See post below:   A post shared by M.O.R.I.L.I (@funmiawelewa)
