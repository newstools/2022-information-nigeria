Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has expressed that state governors are not against the option of direct primaries for conducting elections. “There is a total misunderstanding that the governors are against direct primaries. The governors are definitely not against direct primaries. As a matter of fact, a lot of the states chose whether to do direct or indirect.” He stated this during a Citizens’ town hall on the Electoral bill on Sunday. Governor Sule noted that the electoral bill is more than just the direct or indirect mode of primaries for political parties.

All we said was that why don’t you leave the options. The Electoral Act is far more than just direct or indirect. There are so many important things there, why are we boxing ourselves with either direct or indirect? “Give political parties the opportunity. By the time the opportunities are given, you will be shocked in the 2023 elections, a lot of the states will still do direct,” he said.
