Cross River Governor Ben Ayade has reaffirmed his pledge to restore power to the state’s Southern Senatorial District by 2023. While speaking to some APC stakeholders at the Governor’s Lodge in Calabar on Sunday, Ayade stated that his choice to return power to the south was based on morals. The governor insisted that the south had credible candidates for governorship. “During my campaign for second term, I went to the South and asked them to support my second term bid and that when I win, I will support the south to take over from me because by natural process, they are next senatorial district to produce the governor,” he said.

So there is nothing like balancing, there is no equity in democracy. “There is no moral conscience. Democracy is blind to ethnicity, it is blind to religion, it is blind to fairness, it is repugnant to natural justice,” he said.
