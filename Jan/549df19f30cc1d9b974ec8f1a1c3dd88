Boko Haram terrorists have released four girls abducted in Kautikari village of Chibok Local Government Area of Borno State. The girls were among the 24 persons abducted during an attack on January 14, 2022 in the villages and surrounding villages of Chibok where the insurgents also looted food items and other needful of the villagers. Chibok is about 150km from Maiduguri the Borno State capital and have continued to suffer series of attacks from both Boko Haram and ISWAP elements, prompting the people to cry out recently, blaming the government for abandoning them. It could be recalled that during the incident, which led to the abduction, nine residents of Kautikari village were abducted, before two older women and some children were later released by the insurgents. Also, the four young ladies were taken to Dille by the insurgents. Dille is a village in Askira Uba Local Government Area of Borno State, which shares border with Sambisa forest. It was also said that the village is a hub for the insurgents in the area. Kautikari is located East and about 15km drive from Chibok town, predominantly occupied by Christian faithful. The people said the attack on Kautikari village is more than 20 times since the abduction of the 276 Chibok girls in 2014 that brought the area into limelight.
