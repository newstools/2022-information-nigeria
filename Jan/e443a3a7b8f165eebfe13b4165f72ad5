The government of Ekiti has issued a warning about a rumored scheme by “some political interests” to smear Kayode Fayemi, the state’s governor. The governor’s principal press secretary, Yinka Oyebode, claimed in a statement that some members of the All Progressive Congress (APC) are concerned about Fayemi’s “growing prominence” and are searching for ways to de-market him as the 2023 presidential race approaches. He went on to say that the objective is to discredit Fayemi and make him unpopular with the general public.

This plot is part of their game plan for the 2023 presidential contest. “For the avoidance of doubt, Dr Fayemi has not told anyone that he is in the race for the Presidency of Nigeria. He has always maintained that he is on duty in Ekiti and would like to concentrate on that assignment. What he does afterwards is in the hands of God and he will cross that bridge at the appropriate time. He restated this position during his most recent interview with Arise TV on January 1, 2022.,” the statement read partly.
