 Reno Omokri Former Presidential aide and author, Reno Omokri, on Thursday has reacted after Garba Shehu stated that President Muhammadu Buhari would hand over to an All Progressives Congress, APC, government in 2023. Omokri said he wonders if Buhari plans to rig the 2023 presidential election. Recall that Buhari’s aide, Garba Shehu, had claimed the president would hand over to an APC government. Shehu spoke in response to claims that Buhari shifted subsidy removal to the next government. Garba had made the remarks while addressing journalists after the weekly Federal Executive Council, FEC, meeting at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. Reacting, Omokri, in a tweet, wrote: “However,  statement that Buhari would hand over to an APC Government in 2023 is a threat to democracy and free and fair elections. “What happens if a non APC wins in 2023? Does Buhari plan to rig? Is that why he wanted another of his spokespersons in INEC?”
