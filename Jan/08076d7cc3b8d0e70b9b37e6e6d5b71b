According to Kassim Afegbua, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, former vice-president Atiku Abubakar abandoned his supporters after the 2019 elections. During the 2019 elections, Afegbua served as the spokesperson for Atiku Abubakar’s presidential campaign. On Sunday, the PDP chairman said Atiku should not become a “perpetual candidate” for the presidency, and that the country’s next president must come from the south. Afegbua and Segun Showunmi, a PDP chieftain and Atiku supporter, were interviewed on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Tuesday. When asked about what transpired after the 2019 elections, Afegbua revealed that instead of re-strategizing, the former vice-president left his campaign team in Nigeria and relocated to Dubai.
