The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has stated that no date has been set for the selling of Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) forms for the 2022 academic year. Dr. Fabian Benjamin, the board’s spokesperson, announced this in a statement released in Abuja on Thursday. He claimed that reports about the start of the sale of the 2022 UTME and Direct Entry (DE) were spread by unsavory groups in order to deceive the general public.
