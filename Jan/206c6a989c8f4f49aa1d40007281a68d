 As part of the Federal government’s plan to reduce the menace of touting and extortion, over 90 touts have been arrested by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN). General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Mrs Henrietta Yakubu in a statement on Monday, January 10, disclosed that touts caught at both the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos, and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, were arrested for carrying out nefarious activities. “The touts were arrested for various acts of illegality including arranging fake Covid-19 test results, louting, unauthorised entry, trespass, illegal facilitation, forgery, loitering, theft, public nuisance & arguments, amongst others,” she stated. Of the total arrested, 59 were handed over to the airport police command in Abuja for prosecution, while 30 were handed over to the police force in Lagos.

“FAAN will like to use this opportunity to warn those that do not have any legitimate business at the airports, as well as airport staff carrying out illegal duties to desist from such acts, as the Authority will not hesitate to arrest and hand over such individuals for prosecution,” Yakubu said.
