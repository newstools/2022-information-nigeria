According to Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, a spokesman for the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), 90% of Nigerian governors have no business being in office. Baba Ahmed stated his submission was based on the reality that “they don’t have the preparation, the background, or the competencies to govern” at the 19th Daily Trust Dialogue in Abuja.
