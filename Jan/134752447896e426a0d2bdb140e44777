According to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, young Nigerians are making their mark in domains such as technology, environmental sanitation, agriculture, public health, and education, among others, and the Federal Government will continue to encourage them in reaching their full potential. Professor Osinbajo revealed this on Thursday at the State House in Abuja at the 2021 National Gold Award presentation ceremony of the Nigerian equivalent of the Duke of Edinburgh International Award for Young People. Hailing the various ways in which young people contribute to the nation’s wellbeing, the Vice President cited the example of “young Nigerians in our armed forces leaving behind family and friends to serve our country in various internal security operations across the country”.
