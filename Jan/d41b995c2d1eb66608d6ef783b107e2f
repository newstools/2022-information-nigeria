Big Brother Naija star, Princess Francis has claimed that for a man to be very successful, he needs more than one woman in his life. She made the claim on her social media post. According to her, since there is a woman behind every successful man, if a man wants to be more successful, he should increase the number of women in his life. She wrote, “Behind every successful man there’s a woman! If you need more success, increase your number of women” See her post below:  The former National Deputy Publicity Secretary of the party made the comment during an interview on Channels Television’s Newsnight which will air later this evening. “The beauty of it is that you are sure to contain your local governments; the people, their lives and properties day and night, and they (those running it) would be people who will be hired within that community,” he noted.
