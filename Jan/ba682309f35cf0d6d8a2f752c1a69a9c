Senator Rochas Okorocha has alleged that Governor Hope Uzodinma is plotting to stop him from running for the presidency in 2023. Speaking to newsmen at his Spilbat mansion on Thursday, Okorocha, who now represents Imo West Senatorial zone, alleged that Uzodimma’s government is filled with “deceit and lies.” He said one example of this deceit is Uzodimma’s failure to fulfil his promise of naming those sponsoring insecurity in the state. He alleged that Uzodimma has a strike force called ‘Hopism Strike Force’.

He said, “I have been a governor for eight years and I am now the Senator. I will not be contesting for governor again neither am I contesting for senate or House of Representatives. I am only going federal. My only problem with him may be is because I want to contest for presidency, which he’s trying to stop me or my son-in-law who may probably contest with him in 2023. But let tell you, Uzodinma cannot stop me from running for presidency and if he wants to try, I am waiting for him.” Okorocha also debunked allegations that he wants to defect from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), saying that as a founding member of APC, he is still in the ruling party.
