Nyesom Wike, the governor of Rivers State, believes God will not forgive the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) if it fails to rescue Nigerians from the socio-economic hardships brought on by the APC-led Federal Government’s policies. He emphasized that for the PDP to achieve this goal, all governors of the main opposition party must work together. This was revealed by the governor during a courtesy visit to Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde at Government House in Ibadan on Tuesday.

If the party is united, the governors are united, I can tell you that victory will be ours.”
