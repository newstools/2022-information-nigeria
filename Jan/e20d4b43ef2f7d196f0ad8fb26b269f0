The Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) warned the federal government that all measures impacting Nigerians’ living standards must be halted by 2022 and that it will reject any attempt to inflict more suffering on the people. State governors who are starving pensioners and workers with their pensions and the new minimum wage have been cautioned by Congress not to force them into further hardship. This was stated by NLC President Ayuba Wabba in a new year message made available to journalists in Abuja on Saturday. He specifically said the labour movement was concerned about ‘’the deceit and duplicity associated with the politics of petrol price increase” by successive Nigerian governments.
