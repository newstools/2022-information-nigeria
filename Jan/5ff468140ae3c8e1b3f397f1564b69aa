According to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), every candidate running in the general elections in 2023 would be required to submit bank statements for inspection. This was said by INEC Chairman Mahmood Yakubu, who was represented by Kunle Ajayi, INEC’s national commissioner, at a high-level policy discussion on political campaign finance held in Abuja on Friday. In addition, the INEC chairman threatened to penalize banks for failing to disclose suspicious transactions involving politicians during election campaigns. “We have not officially declared a notice for the 2023 general elections, but when we so declare, we will put our monitoring committees to motion like the central banks, the DSS, the EFCC, the ICPC, the (commercial) banks and other law enforcement agencies,” he said.

He added that money politics, undue influence of money, marginalisation, particularly of women and youths and other vulnerable members of the electorates, are hampering participation.
