Nigeria, according to Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, requires citizens who regard the country’s ethnic variety as a tool for long-term growth. According to his spokesperson, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo spoke during the weekend in Edo at the ceremony conferring the traditional title of ‘Oduma of Auchi Sacred Kingdom’ to Clem Agba, minister of state for budget and planning.
