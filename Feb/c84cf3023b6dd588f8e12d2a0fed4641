 The All Progressives Congress (APC) claims that Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the state’s governor, will not require the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to win re-election in 2023. The APC made the statement in response to statements attributed to Ganiu Taofik, a Lagos state PDP chieftain. Taofik previously stated that the party is prepared to accommodate the governor if he want to run for re-election. Seye Oladejo, a spokesman for the Lagos APC, characterized the PDP’s gubernatorial ticket as “worthless” in a statement released on Friday.
