 Pastor David Ibiyeomie of Salvation Ministry claims that a high percentage of divorce is currently occurring over the world as a result of couples’ ideologies prior to marriage. The renowned clergyman said during a sermon at the church’s headquarters in Port Harcourt that some people enter marriage with the intention of divorcing if things go bad. He urged church members to embrace marriage with the mindset of staying forever, saying it is wrong to expect divorce in marriage.

So, from the beginning of the marriage failure has started because the expectation was wrong. “Look, I am going in, if it doesn’t work then I’ll step out”. I can tell you that you will divorce because from the beginning you have a faulty expectation. Why must you expect that you will pack out? “When you have a strong expectation, you won’t be confused by anything, you’re sure that this thing must happen”.
