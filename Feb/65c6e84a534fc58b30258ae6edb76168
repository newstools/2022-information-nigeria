According to Nigeria’s Chief Justice, Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, the federal government files more charges than it can prove in court. The CJN remarked this in response to Attorney-General Abubakar Malami’s assertion that the judiciary is to responsible for delays in prosecuting high-profile cases. Malami said the federal government has taken steps to ensure quick case resolution, and that once a matter is filed before the court, it becomes a judiciary concern, in an appearance on Channels Television’s ‘Politics Today’ on Monday.
