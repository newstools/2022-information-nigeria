Godwin Emefiele, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has been encouraged to run for president in 2023 by the Green Alliance, a coalition group. Wale Fapounda, the group’s convener, said the country needs a technocrat who can handle the country’s affairs during a news conference in Lagos on Saturday.
