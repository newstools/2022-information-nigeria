Six suspects have been arrested by the police for allegedly running an illegal rehabilitation centre in Kano state. They were also said to have tortured one student to death at Naibawa ‘Yan Lemo Quarters, in Kumbotso Local Government Area. Spokesman of the command, SP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa disclosed this to Dailypost. He said the arrest came after the police received a report from ten (10) escaped inmates of the illegal rehabilitation center, operated by a 55-year-old man, Musa Safiyanu and his accomplices, where they chained, tortured and locked inmates. The report said in the process, one of the inmates, a 22-year-old Aminu Ado was tortured to death. Kiyawa explained that on receipt of the report, the Commissioner of Police, Kano State Command, CP Sama’ila Shu’aibu Dikko raised and instructed a team of detectives to rescue the victims and arrest the culprits. He said the team succeeded in identifying the center and one hundred and thirteen (113) inmates were discovered confined and locked up in a room, with various degrees of injuries. Kiyawa said the victims were rushed to Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital Kano for treatment and were later handed over to Kano State Government. He said six suspects were arrested in the centre. He said the suspects confessed to have been operating the centre for over ten (10) years despite the initial ban by the Kano State Government. The suspects will be charged to court after completion of investigation.
