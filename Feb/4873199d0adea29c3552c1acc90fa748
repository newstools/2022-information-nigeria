From there he must go to mortuary. He wouldn’t come back. He will die. I wouldn’t even pray for repentance. It’s death because if he comes back, another person will try it. Unless if Ananias and Sapphira did not die. If those ones died, then God must kill the person.” Watch the video below:   A post shared by Linda Ikejis Blog (@lindaikejisblogofficial)
