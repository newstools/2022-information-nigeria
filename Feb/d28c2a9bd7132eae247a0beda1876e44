Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo’s spokesperson, Laolu Akande, says his boss has not decided whether or not to run for president in 2023. Several groups have requested the vice president to run for president ahead of the general election. Concerned Citizens of Nigeria began an online petition in January, urging Nigerians to convince Osinbajo to run for president in 2023. Meanwhile, there were indications on Monday that Osibanjo might declare his interest in running for president following the All Progressives Congress’s (APC) national conference on February 26.

Please continue to ignore the speculations.”
