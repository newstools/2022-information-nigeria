He asked; is this really the Kano state I used to know? He was answered yes. He then asked who is responsible for this transformation and people said it was Kwankwaso and Ganduje that transformed Kano. They are responsible for the new face of Kano State. “We (Kwankwaso and Ganduje) have done our best in lifting the face of Kano State. And I will continue to maintain this as a governor of the state,” he said. He appreciated the party leadership from the national to state level for standing with them during the crisis in the party, calling on all those that were wronged in one way or the other to come back build the state to move forward.
