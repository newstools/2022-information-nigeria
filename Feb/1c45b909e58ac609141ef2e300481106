Nigeria does not need someone who wants to be president solely because he is wealthy, according to Pat Utomi, a political economy professor. In an interview with the Nigerian News Agency (NAN) on Sunday, Utomi stated that the country requires a selfless and intellectual leader to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Utomi, a former presidential candidate on the African Democratic Congress (ADC) platform, stated that a coalition that will transform the country in 2023 will be announced soon.

We need a person, who is interested in collegial leadership. “The prospect of a coalition that will change Nigeria, which I envisage, and is being put together as we speak, is a coalition of the youth, the women, the intellectuals and the professionals.”
