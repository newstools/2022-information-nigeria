He insisted the time for Nigeria’s political leaders to make personal sacrifices for the survival of democracy was now, ”People like us who are in our 70s have been called analogue and therefore, phased out, we accept with grace that we are old. “We must give Nigeria the kind of leaders it deserves, not based on ethnic background, religion or zone, but based on his capacity, competence and we want a Nigerian leader and president, not the president of either the north or south, so to me, zoning doesn’t have meaning any more.” According to him, zoning should not be the issue in Nigeria’s political terrains, asking, “Those clamouring for zoning? Who are they giving orders, who are they commanding? I believe there has to be a common understanding, we should come together and mutually agree on the issue about the country.”
