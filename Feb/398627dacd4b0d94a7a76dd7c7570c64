Oyetola, who spoke in his ward in Iragbiji, Boripe LGA, said the election should not be viewed as a conflict. He said, “I want to appeal to all our people across the State to maintain peace. Election process should not be a battle field or a do-or-die affair.

We have been in contact with a number of places and we have received positive signals of peace. “Really, I don’t see why choosing a candidate to represent the Party should bring violence.” Oyetola said the election should not be seen as a battleground. He added, “I will win by the grace of God. The other choice is not there. I want to appeal to all of us to see this issue as a family affair. We are APC all through. “We should brace up for the challenge ahead. We are going to face another party whose candidate we don’t know yet. I want to appeal to us to ensure that we have an opportunity for reconciliation.”
