Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has decried the detention of Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a. Igboho. He said the Yoruba activist did nothing wrong and accused Benin Republic of disregarding fundamental human rights. Adams commended Igboho’s lawyer, Yomi Alliyu (SAN) for moving to seek redress from the ECOWAS Court. A statement on Tuesday by spokesman, Kehinde Aderemi, called the elongation of the agitator’s detention without trial “misplacement of justice”. The traditional leader tackled Benin Republic for taking the case “far beyond the normal legal procedures”. Adams insists Igboho “never committed any crime”, but only expressed “his displeasure under the ambit of law”. “Despite the fact that there were no criminal charges against him, the Beninese Court detained him unjustly without trial. “The extension of the detention of Igboho further exposed the frailty in the administration of justice. “The young man’s rights have been trampled upon, spending much longer than it should for a person not yet convicted of any offence.” The Aare urged Yorubas in the diaspora to present Igboho’s case to the global community. Adams added that efforts should be made to approach the African Union Court (AUC) and International Court of Justice (ICJ). Igboho, a vocal secessionist, was arrested in July 2021 as he attempted to flee to Europe after the Nigerian government declared him wanted.
