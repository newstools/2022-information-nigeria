There’s no doubt, this is a welcome development. It’s good for intellectuals to take a role in politics because they analyse and lead the people because there are always conflicting variables. “In Nigeria, intellectuals are afraid of governance because they say that too much analysis can lead to paralysis and also see politics as a dirty game. But politics is not a dirty game. There is a connection between intellectualism and governance.”
