Daniel Bwala, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has stated that, contrary to common belief, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will not contest for the presidency in 2023. On Tuesday, Mr Bwala, a guest on Channels TV’s Politics Today, said this in response to concerns about the APC and PDP’s chances in the next elections, as well as a “third force” and the country’s general new leadership plan. When listed among those who are going to run under the APC, Mr Bwala emphatically said: “Yemi Osinbajo is not running for President”.
