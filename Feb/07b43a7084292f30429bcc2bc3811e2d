On Wednesday, the Arewa Consultative Forum slammed Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), the Governor of Ondo State and Chairman of the Southern Governors’ Forum, for claiming that any political party fielding a northern candidate in the 2023 presidential election will lose. The northern group contended that as a legal luminary, the governor should know better when it comes to choosing someone for the nation’s most coveted position. The organization advised Akeredolu not to issue threats, claiming that intimidation would not win the South the presidency next year.

However, the ACF through its National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe, drew the attention of the governor to constitutional provisions for electing the presidential candidate of any political party in the country as president. The ACF spokesman in an interview with The PUNCH in Kaduna, said, “Governor Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN) should know that presidential candidate needs votes from 24 states and not 17 (south) and 19 (north) to win the seat. That is what the Constitution says. “As a very senior lawyer, Governor Akeredolu should know the provisions of the constitution. It is therefore not possible for a group of states to come together and say we ‘must’ produce the president. Anybody eying that seat must traverse the country, north and south to meet the demands of the Constitution.”
