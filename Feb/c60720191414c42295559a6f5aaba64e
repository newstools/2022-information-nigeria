At this moment we should be thinking in advance way that is to apply modern politics as practice in the world. Nigeria as a country should begin to work towards the unity, peace, progress and economic development of the country and its citizens. “For me that is the leader I want to support. Anybody that is ready and committed to making Nigeria great should be encouraged and supported wherever he comes from. I don’t mind his tribe, his religion or region, that is the person we should all support. Look at our country today, where has the zoning taken us to?” he asked.
