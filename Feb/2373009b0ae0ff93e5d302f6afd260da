Nigerians have condemned Titilayo, the mother of reality TV star, Angel Agnes Smith. This comes after she showed too much flesh during a dance video she posted on her social media page. Titilayo posted a video of herself dancing and twerking clad in a bum short that exposed her backside. She captioned the video: I didn’t want to post this video before but my baby @theangeljbsmith said she loves it. My mood all week knowing it’s only 5days to my daughter’s birthday. However, Nigerians who saw the video bashed her, saying they expected more from her.
