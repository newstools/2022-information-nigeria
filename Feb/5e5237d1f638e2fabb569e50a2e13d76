The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has expressed that its industrial action can end in one week if the federal government meets its demands. ASUU had declared a nationwide strike on Monday following a two-day deliberation of the union’s national executive council (NEC). Speaking on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, Christopher Piwuna, ASUU’s vice-president, stated that the strike can be called off as soon as government does what it is “supposed to do”.
