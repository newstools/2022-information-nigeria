For the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE) examinations, the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has established self-registration centers in Abuja and Lagos. According to the board, the technique will eventually minimize crowding at computer-based test centers (CBTs) in cities. “This system would, in the long run, reduce the crowds at CBT centres in these cities,” JAMB said in a bulletin. “The conception of this noble idea is to, besides advancing the digital competence of candidates who feel they can do the registration on their own, expand the registration access points in line with COVID-19 protocols.” Also Read: 2022 UTME/DE: JAMB Shifts Registration To February 19 JAMB stated that it was to utilize the digital competence of its increasing number of computer-savvy candidates to ease registration processes.
