 A Divisional Police Officer in Jibiya Local Government Area of Katsina State, DSP Abdullahi Rano, has been shot dead by suspected bandits. Sources disclosed that the bandits invaded the Magama-Jibia community on Wednesday morning. Rano, upon hearing of the invasion by bandits, mobilised, made a reinforcement of officers to the scene and engaged the terrorists in a fierce shoot-out during which he was shot and killed. The village head of Mazanya, Abubakar Sani, confirmed the attack which began at 2 am. The spokesman for the Katsina State Police Command, SP Gambo Isah, did not pick up calls made to his phone and was yet to respond to a text message sent to him for comment. He, however, posted the picture of the late DPO on his WhatsApp status with a label ‘RIP’ on it.
