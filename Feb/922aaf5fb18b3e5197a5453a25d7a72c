In a statement issued on Wednesday, Debo Ologunagba, PDP spokesperson, called on Buhari to quit as minister of petroleum resources and appoint a qualified professional to head the ministry in order to restore sanity to the system. The PDP added that the petroleum ministry as presently constituted is “peopled with persons with no relevant education, experience and expertise to manage this critical sector that accounts for over 90 percent of the revenue of the nation”.
