We are all going to meet in Eagle Square and we will square it out there. There is no difficulty. We are all friends,” he said. “I’m the only political businessman that Forbes recognises as a billionaire and not sure there is anything those people can do in terms of money that I can’t do. I do not think they can speak to anybody in Nigeria or in the world I can’t speak to. “Politics is not only about money. It is going to be about the people you are going to govern. The people will decide. Money is just a secondary issue. “The primary issue we are going to be talking about is the people. I can move people. The people are with me. Money is not going to be a problem I want to assure you. I was governor the same year as Tinubu.”
