Former Minister of Aviation Femi Fani-Kayode believes that Nigeria’s north-central region deserves a chance to produce the country’s next president. This was expressed by Fani-Kayode, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), during an interview on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Monday. He added that while he no longer believes in the election of a president based on zoning, such a person should come from the middle-belt or south-east, preferably the former.
