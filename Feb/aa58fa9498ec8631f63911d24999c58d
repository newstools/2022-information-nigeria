Buhari praised the EU for donating vaccinations to Nigeria and the degree of work being done to tackle the pandemic while speaking at the EUAU Summit in Brussels. “Nigeria is very grateful, COVID-19 has been more or less considerate on Nigeria. The figures of those infected are quite low,” he said.
