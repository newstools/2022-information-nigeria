 Uche Ogbodo, a Nollywood actress, has reacted to accusations that she betrayed her colleague Empress Njamah and caused her separation with Nigerian musician Timaya. Uche allegedly moved into Timaya’s residence in Marwa Garden and began dating one of his boys, Wrekoba, according to Instagram user Cutie Julls. Empress supposedly became pregnant for Timaya, but Uche deceived her by telling Wrekoba that Empress’ pregnancy belonged to a sugar daddy and not Timaya.
