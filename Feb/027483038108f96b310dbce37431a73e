 Williams Uchemba has resorted to social media to express his dissatisfaction with the lifestyle of newborn babies, implying that he has turned into a night time prayer warrior. Williams said in a video posted to his Instagram page that babies have a set pattern that includes eating, pooping, crying, and farting. According to him, changing diapers can be an overwhelming one, and once it’s changed the infant poos again. Because he has been on constant night vigils since the birth of his child, the actor encouraged his followers and colleagues to offer their prayer points.
