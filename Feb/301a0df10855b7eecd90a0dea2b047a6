Edwin Clark, an Ijaw national leader, has urged northern presidential aspirants to reconsider their bids. In a statement released on Monday, Clark urged northern presidential aspirants, including former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Sokoto Governor Aminu Tambuwal, and former Senate President Bukola Saraki, to reconsider their decision to run in the election in order to avert “chaos.” Clark stated that though the concept of zoning is not written in the constitution, “rotation of power” is in the interest of the country’s unity.

Zoning has been practised in the nation’s polity even before Independence, when Tafawa Balewa, in 1954, was the prime minister, Nnamdi Azikiwe was the governor-general. “Zoning of political offices, particularly the presidency of the country, is the best antidote to breakup of Nigeria, and the panacea for peace and unity of the country,” the statement read.
