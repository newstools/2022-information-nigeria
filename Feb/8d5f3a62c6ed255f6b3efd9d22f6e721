Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has urged Nigerian professionals to put ethnicity and religion aside when making critical decisions for the country’s growth. On Monday in Abuja, Osinbajo spoke at the inaugural All Progressives Congress (APC) professional forum conference. According to the vice president, Nigerian professionals must embrace merit-based politics rather than “baseless considerations.” “So, one of the major advantages to our communities of having professionals in politics is lost if we do not recognise that our role as merit-driven persons must be to fight the temptation of ethnic, religious and other parochial considerations in making crucial decisions for the development of our nation,” he said.
