Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) has stated that the Buhari government is committed to addressing the issue of insufficient housing in the country by constructing a nation where low-income people have the dignity of a good house and livelihood. Professor Osinbajo claims that this will not only improve Nigerians’ quality of life but also increase the economy through a thriving housing market. The Vice President made the remarks on Friday in Masaka, Nasarawa State, at the launching of 248 housing units and commemoration of the Millard Fuller Foundation’s 1,000th home.
