The Akwa Ibom State Council of Ministers has called on Governor Udom Emmanuel to rescind his endorsement of Commissioner for Lands and Water Resources, Umo Eno, as his successor in 2023. Apostle Joseph Nyong, the group’s president, and Apostle Elijah Usoh, its secretary, said Eno’s selection was devoid of equity and fairness, and that it was an imposition designed to outsmart the majority of Akwa Ibom people. The organization chastised former Governor Obong Victor Attah for driving the endorsement, and questioned why he colluded with the governor to sabotage the zoning agreement he had started.

It is therefore equitable and fair that it should be micro zoned to the federal constituency of Itu/Ibiono,” the group stated. They dismissed the claim that Emmanuel’s choice is a revelation from God as a bare faced lie to give Eno credence. They warned that if the public outcry against the endorsement was not well handled, it might degenerate into an avoidable crisis ahead of the 2023 general elections.
