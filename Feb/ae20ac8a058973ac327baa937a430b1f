Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed has reiterated that many Non-Governmental Organisations operating in Nigeria are working against Nigeria’s interests. He re-emphasised this on Saturday when he featured on ‘Radio Link’, a phone-in programme of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria. In the programme monitored by the News Agency of Nigeria, the minister said Nigerians should be circumspect about the activities of some NGOs. He stated that the government was in receipt of reports that some of the NGOs were on the payroll of foreign agents, traducers with ulterior motives to destabilise Nigeria. The minister gave the example of the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project which sued the Federal Government when the microblogging site, Twitter, was suspended.
