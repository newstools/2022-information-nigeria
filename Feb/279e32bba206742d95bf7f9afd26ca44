President Muhammadu Buhari’s proposal for the national legislature to repeal article 84(12) of the electoral act, according to Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike, is “selfish.” Following his acceptance of the electoral bill on Friday, Buhari requested that section 84(12) be repealed, as it disenfranchises serving political appointees. The section in contention reads: “No political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.” Wike claimed that the president is also attempting to protect his appointees, and that Buhari’s approach does not encourage free and fair elections.

The function of the executive is to implement the law, and the function of the judiciary is to interpret the law. “Now Mr. President is not only doing the work of the executive, he has also delved into the work of the judiciary of interpreting the law, knowing where there is conflict. “I wonder why Mr President didn’t know when he appended his signature to the Police Trust Fund; that was in conflict with the provision of the constitution.”
