President Muhammadu Buhari has stated that the All Progressives Congress (APC) must be made more appealing to young people in order for them to become active members of the party. Buhari made the remarks when hosting the APC national youth lobby committee, chaired by national youth leader Ismaeel Ahmed, in Abuja on Friday. He stated that the youth are not begging, but rather negotiating, asserting a claim, and attempting to offer value, which he believes is great. The president assured the APC youth lobby committee that the party’s leadership will ensure that young people are fully involved at all levels.
