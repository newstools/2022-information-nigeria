 Governors who are members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have asked President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the reworked electoral act amendment bill into law. The governors’ position was contained in a communiqué released on Monday after a meeting in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa capital. Buhari had declined assent to the bill, citing concerns over the recommendation of direct primaries for political parties.
