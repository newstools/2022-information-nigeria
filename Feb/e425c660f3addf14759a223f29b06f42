Former Presidential aide and activist Reno Omokri has reacted to DSTV assigning channel 419 to the Nigerian government-owned broadcaster, NTA He said it’s DSTV’s way of making a mockery of and demarketing Nigeria. The number “419” refers to the section of the Nigerian Criminal code dealing with fraud and the charges for offenders. As a result, Nigerians refer to any form of financial fraud or scam as “419”. Reno said that DSTV assigning channel 419 to the Nigerian Television Authority “carries a very powerful subliminal message”. His Instagram post reads; “Why has DSTV, a South African company operating in Nigeria, chosen to give the Nigerian Television Authority, @NTANetwork, the frequency channel of 419? That is NOT a coincidence. It is a deliberate action. It is subversive and carries a very powerful subliminal message that demarkets Nigeria as a brand.  The Nigerian Broadcast Commission, that ought to have spotted this, are instead more focused on sanctioning radio and TV stations that criticise the Buhari administration. What a pity!” See his post below.
