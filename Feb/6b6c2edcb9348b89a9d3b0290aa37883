Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti state, has expressed that leaders need to move beyond scoring points against opponents to ensuring quality representation for the people. Fayemi said this on Thursday at the unveiling of his book titled, ‘Unfinished Greatness: Envisioning a New Nigeria’ in Abuja. He also stated that he has devoted a good part of his life and career to the belief that Nigeria is better off together than divided. “Over the last few years, as our beloved country has been buffeted on all sides by a myriad of problems, I have, like many of you here present and online, experienced discomfort at the ease with which cheap and populist options which, yesterday, may have been laughed off as fringe ideas have gained in influence as to become mainstream,” he said.
