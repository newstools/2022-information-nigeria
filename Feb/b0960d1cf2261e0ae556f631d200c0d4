Gboyega Oyetola, the governor of Osun State, has stated that the Peoples Democratic Party has no possibility of matching the APC’s achievements in the state over the last three years. He said that his administration’s visible infrastructure and people-centered programs had won him a good rating among the people at the grassroots. Oyetola told news correspondents late on Thursday in Abuja that he had submitted his nomination and expression of interest forms to the APC national secretariat.
