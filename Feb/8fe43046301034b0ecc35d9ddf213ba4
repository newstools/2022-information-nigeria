 Former US President, Donald Trump has reacted to the invasion of Russian troops in Ukraine, blaming his successor, Joe Biden and North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, over the crisis. Trump speaking at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, blamed Putin’s invasion on Biden’s “weakness”. He hailed President Vladimir Putin’s intellect, describing him as smart and not the real problem. Massive explosions hit Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, on Saturday as many scrambled for help in Poland, Romania. “As everyone understands, this horrific disaster would never have happened if our election was not rigged,” Trump said. Trump blasted NATO for hitting Russia with sanctions rather than hitting them psychologically. NATO, Trump said, was “looking the opposite of smart” for hitting Russia with sanctions rather than resolving to “blow (Russia) to pieces at least psychologically.” “The problem is not that Putin is smart, which of course he’s smart, but the real problem is that our leaders are so dumb,” the former US President said.
