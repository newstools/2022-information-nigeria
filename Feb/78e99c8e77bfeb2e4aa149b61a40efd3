It stated that members resolved to embark on an indefinite strike since the government was not ready to do the needful. While asking Nigerians to prevail on the government to avert the impending strike, the union said it had allowed many stakeholders to talk to the government, which had portrayed the union as a dog, which could only bark but could not bite.
