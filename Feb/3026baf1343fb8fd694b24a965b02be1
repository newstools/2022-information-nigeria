President Muhammadu Buhari claims that the era of the military seizing control of government in Nigeria is ended. Buhari was reacting to Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State’s concerns over the recent recurrence of military takeovers in Mali, Guinea, and Burkina Faso, which occurred in August 2020, September 2021, and January 2022, respectively. Buhari spoke at a dinner in Abuja on Sunday in honor of the 2022 committee of economic, political, media, and civil society leaders, according to presidential spokesman Femi Adesina. Buhari stated that he is confident that “Nigeria has passed through that stage for the good.” Buhari stated that he was looking forward to completing his tenure and leaving a legacy for a united, peaceful, and prosperous Nigeria with 24 years of uninterrupted democracy.
