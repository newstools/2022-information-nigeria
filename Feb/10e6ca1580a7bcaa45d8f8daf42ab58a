Tolu Oniru-Demuren, the popular radio personality, aka Toolz, has addressed the break-up rumour with her husband, Tunde Demuren. There were rumours some time ago that the radio presenter had separated from her husband while she was pregnant. Toolz, in an interview with Chude Jideonwo, said the rumour is false, explaining that she was not wearing her ring at the time because her fingers were swollen and she was pregnant. According to her, the rumour that she moved out of her matrimonial home was not necessary. “The rumour of crisis in my marriage came out because at the time I didn’t wear my wedding ring and I also changed my Instagram bio. “I didn’t wear my ring because it wasn’t fitting anymore, I was pregnant at the time and my fingers were swollen. “The rumour that he moved out was just ridiculous, had my mother worried when she heard because I was pregnant,” she said. Toolz went ahead to share her experience after she had a miscarriage of her first pregnancy. According to her, to date, that time was the most traumatic situation for her because she couldn’t believe it was happening to her. She, however, mentioned that seeing a therapist and being spiritual helped her go through the phase in her life. Toolz said, “I don’t like talking about the miscarriage but at that time I was so lost. They told me I wasn’t going to go through with the pregnancy and if I do, there will be so many issues. “We prayed about it, spoke to different pastors but accepting that it wasn’t going to work made me move on. “It was seven hours of labour to just remove the baby but I just kept praying. I blamed myself but when I spoke to my therapist, I realised it could have happened to anyone. “I’m happy I was able to go through it and I hope my story is an inspiration. I went from crying every single day to getting better.”
