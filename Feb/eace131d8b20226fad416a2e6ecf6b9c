 The All Progressives Congress (APC) chairmanship candidate’s name for the Abuja Municipal Area Council election is missing on the list of names displayed by the INEC. However, that of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chairmanship, and councillorship candidates of all other political parties were conspicuously reflected. The missing name may not be unconnected with the legal fireworks between Alhaji Murtala Kashi and Alhaji Hassan Gwagwa. Until last Thursday when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Alhaji Murtala Kashi as the authentic Abuja Municipal Area Council Chairmanship candidate, Alhaji Hassan Suleiman Gwagwa has been posing as the candidate after the APC primary election that ended in confusion last year. DAILY POST reports that accreditation of voters within the few polling units visited started at about 10.00 a.m. There was also no sign of life threatening situation as voters are conducting themselves in orderly manner, while security operatives seem to be on a red alert around polling units and other strategic locations in Gwagwa, Karmo and Idu. Meanwhile, the Presiding Officer in charge of Gwagwa Karmo, Mrs Agwu Agnes revealed that a total of 2,401 ballot papers were provided by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the Chairmanship and Councillorship election for Gwagwa Jiwa ward.
