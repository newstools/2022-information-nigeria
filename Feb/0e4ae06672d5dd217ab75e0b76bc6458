Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, has urged All Progressives Congress loyalists to be wary of those that are buying membership slips ahead of Saturday’s governorship primary. Oyetola also expressed confidence in the strengths of the party members to elect him at the primary and ensure his emergence at the governorship election. These were contained in a statement titled, ‘You’re a game-changer, you deserve a second term, Owa Obokun of Ijesaland tells Oyetola’, and signed by Oyetola’s spokesman, Ismail Omipidan, on Wednesday.
