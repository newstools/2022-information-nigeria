Rauf Aregbesola, the Minister of Interior, has stated that Governor Adegboyega Oyetola will not be permitted to run for re-election on the APC platform. He urged APC members in the state to vote for his candidate, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, the former Secretary to the State Government, in the party’s primary election on Saturday. Aregbesola stated he could bear betrayal, hypocrisy, and backstabbing from the people he was serving entirely, a remark that some believe relates to APC leader and former Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu.
