Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, has expressed that the new electoral act will prevent political appointees from using public funds for election campaigns. President Muhammadu Buhari signed the electoral act amendment bill on Friday. At the signing ceremony, the president asked the national assembly to delete section 84(11) of the act which bars political appointees from voting or being voted for in party primaries. In an article on Sunday, Shehu asked the national assembly to review the section, which President Muhammadu Buhari had also expressed concern about.
