Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of attempting to “penetrate the leadership” of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Wike made the remarks following a closed-door meeting with party stakeholders in Plateau state on Wednesday. The Rivers governor had earlier appeared in court for the trial of Jonah Jang, the former governor of Plateau, who is being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) alongside Yusuf Pam, the former cashier in the office of the secretary to the state government (OSSG), for alleged misappropriation of N6.32 billion in public funds. Following the court session, Wike met with Jang and Jeremiah Useni, a former PDP governorship candidate. According to a statement by Kelvin Ebiri, his spokesperson, the Rivers governor said the visit was part of efforts to reclaim the state for the opposition party in the next general election.

If the party is not united, no matter how bad APC is, there is no way we can win,” he was quoted as saying. “And so, for me, personal sacrifices can be made if you’ve fought wars for this country, for the unity of Nigeria. Today, Nigeria is bleeding. Not only Nigeria is bleeding, Plateau too is bleeding. I have no apology to say that the people of Plateau state are waiting for you both to put the party together and then you will just take back Plateau state. Plateau state is a natural PDP state. “There are disagreements everywhere. There are disagreements in the party both at the national level. So, it is not a question of ‘I am right’. It is not a question of ‘Jang is right; you are wrong, or you are right; Jang is wrong’. It is a question of, for whatever it takes, can we please, in the name of God, leave our personal interests and make our party move forward. “APC is trying to penetrate our party to make sure that the leadership of the party at the national level is being distracted through one or two persons. But we are making sure that does not happen. While we are doing that, we also want to make sure that the branches are also united. “If the party is united, then we are sure of coasting home in 2023. And not just the national election, also Plateau state, knowing fully well that Plateau is a PDP state but somehow we are no longer in power in Plateau state.
