Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has stated his intention to run for president in order to prevent the country from disintegrating completely. Tambuwal, who continued his consultation in Gusau, the capital of Zamfara State, said the country was currently a sinking ship in need of a capable leader to preserve it from catastrophic collapse. He said that he defected from his former party, the Peoples Democratic Party, in 2015, when he was Speaker of the House of Representatives, to join the All Progressives Congress because of security concerns during the administration of Goodluck Jonathan.
