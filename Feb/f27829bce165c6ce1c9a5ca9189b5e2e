The Peoples Democratic Party’s Anambra State chapter has offered to buy the party’s nomination form for Dr Peter Obi, the state’s former governor. The party asked the former governor to “take a shot at the presidential campaign” in the 2023 general elections in a statement released on Friday based on their resolutions at the extended State Executive Committee meeting, adding that members would purchase the nomination form for him. The statement by the state chapter of the PDP read in part, “This decision of the party became expedient following a motion moved by Chief Ken Emeakayi and supported by Chief Okey Muo Aroh.
