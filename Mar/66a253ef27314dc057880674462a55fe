The president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Olumide Akpata, believes that Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi has done the right thing by apologizing for his outburst over a court decision dismissing him. A federal high court in Abuja ordered Umahi and Eric Igwe to resign as governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi, respectively, on Tuesday. Umahi had previously stated that no one could remove him from office and referred to the judge as a “hatchet man” in response to the court’s decision.
