Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, has pleaded with President Muhammadu Buhari, governors on the platform of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), their deputies and all other stakeholders to consider the candidature of Senator George Akume, for the position of the national chairman “for the sake of fairness, equity, and justice.” Governor Zulum made the plea in Abuja when he paid a courtesy call to the former Benue State governor. He said if Akume emerged as the chairman of the party, it would give Christians in the party a sense of belonging. He said: “One thing about me is that I don’t pretend.
