 Recall that in February 2021, Gift went public with the domestic violence allegation and also shared photos and videos of the injuries she sustained after she was attacked by the singer. Days after he was dropped by the DMW record label owned by Davido, Gift filed charges against Lil Frosh. The case has since been in court since then. On Monday, March 28, both Lil Frosh and his ex-girlfriend took to their Instagram pages to announce that they have reconciled and proceeded to withdraw the case from court. Lil Frosh shared a public statement from his lawyer which said; “The above subject matter refers. We are Counsel to Wasiu Goriola also known as Lil Frosh (our client) on whose behalf we write. This is to notify the public and well-wishers of our client about the development in the criminal charge/suit brought against our client.
