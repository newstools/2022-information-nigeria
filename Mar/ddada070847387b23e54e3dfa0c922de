He made this clarification while delivering a keynote address on Thursday at a media conference organised by the National Association of Judiciary Correspondents (NAJUC), Abuja chapter. Malami described reports of his purported resignation to further a political ambition as “fake news”. He added that there need to be sanctions for persons who publish “fake” reports. “Many public officers have been victims of malicious media reports — mischievous and deliberate distortion of facts,” he said.
