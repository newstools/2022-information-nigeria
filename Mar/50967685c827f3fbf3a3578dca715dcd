The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to issue Certificates of Return to Governor Iduma Igariwe and Deputy Governor Fred Udogwu of Ebonyi State as soon as possible. Following the Federal High Court’s refusal to give a Stay of Execution to Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. David Nweze Umahi, and his Deputy, Kelechi Igwe, over their removal from office by the Court, the party claimed the demand had become necessary.
