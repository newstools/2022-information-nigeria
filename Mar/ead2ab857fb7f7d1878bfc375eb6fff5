The national assembly has officially received communication from President Muhammadu Buhari asking it to delete a clause in the electoral act. This was contained in a letter read by Senate President Ahmad Lawan on the floor of the upper legislative chamber on Tuesday. Buhari asked the lawmakers to expunge section 84 (12) of the electoral act of 2022 because it disenfranchises serving political officers.
