 American rapper Kanye West has been officially banned from Instagram for 24 hours. The rapper’s suspension comes after his posts towards his ex-wife Kim Kardashian were reported to have fallen short of the hate speech, harassment and bullying policy of the platform. A statement by the photo-sharing app said it would take ‘additional steps’ if it saw further violations of its policies.
