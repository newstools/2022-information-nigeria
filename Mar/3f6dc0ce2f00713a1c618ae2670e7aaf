Kwara State Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq has asked the national assembly to have a rethink on the rejected gender bills in order to make Nigeria’s political system gender-friendly. Abdulrazaq said this in a statement issued on Friday. Recall that senators and members of the house of representatives voted against bills seeking to amend the constitution to provide more opportunities for women in politics and governance. Speaking on the development, the Kwara governor said such rejection doesn’t tell well on efforts to promote fair representation in governance.
