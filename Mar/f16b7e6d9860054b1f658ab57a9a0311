The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has revealed that the printing of permanent voter cards (PVCs) for new registrants has been delayed due to the clean-up of the voters’ register. Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman, disclosed this on Monday at the five-day induction retreat for national commissioners in Lagos. The cleaning of the voters’ register is done to remove names of dead persons, non-Nigerians who may have been registered, as well as other categories of ineligible persons. The INEC chairman said the commission is encouraged by the response of citizens on the ongoing continuous voter registration (CVR) exercise.
