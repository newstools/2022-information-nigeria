Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma has stated that it will amount to “ingratitude” for people from the south-east to say President Muhammadu Buhari neglected the region. Uzodinma stated that only the Buhari-led administration fulfilled the promise of completing the second Niger bridge. On March 8, Babatunde Fashola, minister of works and housing, said the second Niger bridge will be completed in April. Speaking on Monday in an interview with Channels, the Imo governor said successive governments before Buhari’s administration paid lip service to the completion of the bridge. “Today, whether you like it or not, the party to beat is APC. I come from the south-east. Since after the civil war, the only gateway out of the south-east — the entire old eastern Nigeria — was that old river Niger bridge,” he said.
