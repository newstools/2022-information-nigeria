 Erelu Okin of Orile Kemta, Pearl Chidinma Ogbolu, has revealed that she has turned herself to Lagos police following the controversy surrounding the use of fuel as souvenir at her party. The command headquarters is probing the distribution of petrol as souvenir at her installation party last week. Videos of kegs containing the petroleum product triggered condemnation upon which the state government acted. The intention was to show appreciation to guests “for turning up at my event at these hard times”, Ogbolu had explained. The Lagos government already sealed Havilah Events Centre in Oniru for contravening public safety rules. In an Instagram post of her police meeting on Tuesday, Ogbolu again apologized for the controversial act. “I have ‘reported’ myself to the police this morning. My intent is to help with their investigation of the unfortunate incident. “I am thankful that my error in judgment has not caused damage and I plead with you all not throw the baby away with the dirty water. “I am sorry and my intent was never to endanger anyone or abuse your sensibilities. Do not destroy me because of my unintentional error. I have come to regret my error “I intend to focus on safety and security and will put my energy on ensuring that my community works include safety and security,” she said. The Erelu further disclosed that she personally delivered an apology letter to the office of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.
