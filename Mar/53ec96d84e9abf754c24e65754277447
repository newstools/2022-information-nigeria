They will crumble.” Amid rumours and speculations that he has left for the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), he insisted that he remained in the PDP, but his new political movement, the National Movement has joined the NNPP. He stated that the NNPP which is seen as the third force will get stronger than the PDP and become the second force if he joins the party.
