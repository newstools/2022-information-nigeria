Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto, has asked the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to zone its presidential ticket to the north. Tambuwal stated this on Tuesday when he met members of the party in Lafia, the capital of Nasarawa, to discuss his presidential ambition. He stated that with the administration of former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan, the south has accounted for over 14 years of the party’s 16 years in power. He also stated that the late President Umaru Yar’Adua, who was from the north, only spent two years in office before control shifted to the south.
