And as soon as he comes back, he will also take over the realms of the party.” “To remove Buni, a meeting of the National Executive Committee must be convened, Uzodimma added. “The right organ of the party to take and implement such decisions is the National Executive Committee. Have we summoned that committee? Because if we do, INEC will be invited to observe. And if they observe, whatever decision taken will be known to them.”
