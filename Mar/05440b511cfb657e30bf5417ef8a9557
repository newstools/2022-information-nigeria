Portable took to his Instagram story channel, accused some people to be behind the evil situation as his Range Rover could be seen facing a building it has hit. He also gave an account of how the crash happened as he suggested that some people with fetish hands have touched the ride: “Help me remove my car before it tumbles I applied the brake when it was going on a free movement. Check the high hill I want to climb. They have an eye on this car, they’ve touched it with magical hands but nothing will happen to a child of God. I will remove part of the money we use for enjoyment to fix it, the front and back haven’t spoil.”
