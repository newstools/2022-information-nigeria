National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu argued that democratic values in Nigeria have steadily declined in the past seven years under the current administration. Ayu stated this on Thursday in Abuja when he received in audience a seven-person delegation of the European Union Election Observer Mission, led by its Chief Election Observer, Maria Arena. According to a statement on Thursday by his Special Adviser on Communication and Strategy, Simon Imobo-Tswam, Ayu told the EU delegation that its report on the 2019 general elections reflected the drawbacks saying “we will keep complaining as long these undemocratic practices subsist.” He boasted that the PDP, in its 16 years in power, not only safeguarded Nigerian democracy, but also established institutions that strengthened it.

These are not just empty pronouncements.”
