Governor Godwin Obaseki has urged those who are not comfortable with the Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to leave the party immediately. Obasseki said this while addressing party stakeholders in Benin City on Monday. Recall that Obaseki’s deputy, Phillip Shaibu had complained that the party they joined in September 2019 when they were forced out of the APC, is not treating them well and has refused to accept them.
