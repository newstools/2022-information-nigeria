Popular Nigerian Disc Jockey, Florence Otedola also known as DJ Cuppy, has reacted to a fan’s suggestion for her to become a baby mama. It all started with post by Cuppy, where she shared photos of her and her pet dogs, Fufun and Dudun, and gushed over them. A man identified as Daniel Jackson, took to her comment section and asked her to find man who would impregnate her rather than referring to her dogs as kids. He wrote; ”@cuppymusic why don’t you just find a guy that’ll impregnate you then calling those pets your kids???…being a single mom isn’t a bad thing.” @cuppymusic why don't you just find a guy that'll impregnate you then calling those pets your kids???…being a single mom isn't a bad thing. — Daniel Jackson (@UrboyItua) March 23, 2022
