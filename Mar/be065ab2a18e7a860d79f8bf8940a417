National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Victor Oye, has stated that former Governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, performed impressively while in office for eight years and should be allowed to take his “deserved rest” after serving the people of the state. Oye stated this on Friday in a chat with The PUNCH while reacting to the arrest of the 66-year-old ex-governor by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The APGA chairman warned the anti-graft agency to stop the witch-hunt of Obiano and allow him to take his “deserved rest” anywhere he chose to have it.
