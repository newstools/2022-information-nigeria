President Muhammadu Buhari has apologised to Nigerians over the petrol scarcity and power outage experienced in the country. Since February, there has been petrol scarcity in the country following the importation of off-spec petrol into the country. The scarcity, although now easing off in parts of the country, led to hike in the price of petrol as well as long queues at filling stations. Meanwhile, there are currently reports of power outages across the country, with the national grid said to have collapsed twice within the past 72 hours.
