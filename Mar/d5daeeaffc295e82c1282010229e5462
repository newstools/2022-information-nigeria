After my bad marriage, I decided to concentrate only on my career and children. “But when he came into my life, there was so much joy and peace. He is really a good man and I tell him all the time, so when he proposed to me, I decided that I didn’t want to lose that beautiful experience.” “I do not know how or why critics came up with the notion that I married him for his money. As a matter of fact, I am working for him because we are business partners. We complement each other, and I also bring something to the table. “I am not poor. I did not just walk into the relationship (with nothing). I am adding value to our marriage and he is also adding value to me. I work hard for my money, I make a lot of money from influencing and advertising for brands, and it is sad that some people think of me as a gold digger.”
