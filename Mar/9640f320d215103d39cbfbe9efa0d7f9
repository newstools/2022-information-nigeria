Bola Tinubu, a presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has stated that he wants to step into the shoes of President Muhammadu Buhari — and not on his toes. Tinubu spoke on Wednesday while making his case for the presidential ticket of the ruling party during a meeting with APC senators in Abuja. The former Lagos governor asked the lawmakers to back his ambition, urging them to consider his “experience and capacity”. “I came for your counsel, partnership and support. I believe that you can back me for my lifetime ambition,” he said. Also Read: 2023 Presidency: Tinubu To Meet APC Senators Wednesday “Nigeria has come to a point where we need a change of baton.
