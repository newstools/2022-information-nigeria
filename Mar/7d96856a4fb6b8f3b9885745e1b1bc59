I appeared on Politics Today on Channels and this question came and I answered it. “Up till now, nobody is able to tell me the meaning of “yahoo yahoo”. And if I don’t understand it, I don’t see how I can respond to it. I don’t know whether it means good or bad. Maybe it means good. If I condemn it, it means I’m condemning a good thing. Maybe you help me to interpret “yahoo yahoo” and then we can manage it from there.”
