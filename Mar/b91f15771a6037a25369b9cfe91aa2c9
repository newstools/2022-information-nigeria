Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has urged Nigerians to vote for a credible presidential candidate in 2023. Uzodinma stated that zoning the Presidency to the Southeast would be good, but the 1999 constitution does not recognize such. He urged Nigerians to vote for credible presidential candidates based on merit and not zoning. Uzodinma disclosed this to journalists on the sidelines of the first plenary of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Nigerian in Abuja on Sunday.

Actually, in the books of our democracy (1999 Constitution), tribe or place of origin is not a factor. “So, all I say in my good conscience and moral instinct is that Nigerians should vote in a representative manner where everyone will have a feel of what the Presidency is in reality, but beyond that and very importantly, is the need for merit and competence. “They should be the driving criteria for selecting a president. This country has gone through a lot of trouble and temptations. It is high time we did this rightly in Nigeria.”
