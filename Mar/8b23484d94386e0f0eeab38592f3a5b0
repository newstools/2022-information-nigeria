The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, on Monday, said its mock Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (JAMB) would now hold on April 9, 2022 as against the earlier scheduled date of April 16, 2022. The board stated that it made the decision upon the realisation that April 16 would be Easter Sunday. The board added that as of February 26, 2022, no fewer than 236,206 candidates had registered for the 2022 examinations. These were disclosed in the weekly bulletin of the board made available in Abuja on Monday. The bulletin read in part, “The 2022 mock UTME is now to hold on Saturday, April 9, 2022, and not Saturday, April 16, 2022, as earlier scheduled.

Therefore, all candidates, who wish to register early so as to sit for the mock UTME, are to kindly note the change of date.”
