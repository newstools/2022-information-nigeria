According to them, the management’s action is following their children’s absence in a prayer session held to bid them farewell from the institution. According to one of the parents, the students were absent when Dr. David Oyedepo came to pray for them, Vanguard reports. “Sir, this issue may not be your business, but, I feel as an affairs analyst, you can add your voice to 200 families who are in pain,” a text message allegedly from one of the parents read.
