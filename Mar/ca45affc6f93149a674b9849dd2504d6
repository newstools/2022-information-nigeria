 Ex- governor of Ogun State, Gbenga Daniel on Tuesday said that Nigeria does not need fasting and prayer to tackle the problems facing it. Daniel said Nigerians must work to ensure that their potential is fulfilled in order to see the country prosper. “For Nigeria to reach its potential it does not require prayer and fasting. God has done his own work for the country. It is left for us to work to ensure our potentials do not become liabilities,” the ex-governor said as the keynote speaker at Freedom Online’s fourth annual lecture in Lagos. According to Daniel, the country requires a realist as a leader, not an idealist. “It appears that what is required for a prosperous Nigeria is beyond stylish leadership and idealism, rather what is most required in today’s world is realism. I believe realism is born out of experience,” he said. The 65-year-old called on the electorate to elect new leaders in 2023 with their brains, saying Nigerians “need to vote with their brains, not their stomach.” Former governor of Kaduna State Senator Ahmed Makarfi chaired the session. Others present included ex-governor of Anambra State Peter Obi and minister of information and culture Lai Mohammed.
