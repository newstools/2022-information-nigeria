Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Committee of the All Progressives Congress, Governor Mai Mala Buni, has affirmed that all action that was taken in his absence by the CECPC acting Chairman, Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State remain valid. Buni made the clarification after several reports claimed that he dumped the national convention sub-committee list earlier adopted by Bello in an apparent move to assert his leadership after President Muhammadu Buhari’s endorsement. It was earlier reported that Buhari put his foot down on Wednesday, insisting that Buni should be allowed to continue as the chairman of the party following a botched attempt by APC governors to remove him as the Chairman after he (Buni) left the country for medical attention.
