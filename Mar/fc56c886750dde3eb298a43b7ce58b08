Doyin Okupe, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has stated that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will cease to exist if refuses to zone its presidential ticket. Okupe said this in a series of tweets on Friday. Okupe stated that since parties don’t select candidates from the same religion for their presidential and vice-presidential tickets, it would be wrong for a northerner to take over power from President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. “Perfidy is the word. Dishonesty, injustice and insensitivity are the hallmarks of the current attitude of the PDP towards its own established policy of fairness and its celebrated mantra for equity and justice in the sharing of political offices through zoning between the north and the south of the country,” he wrote.
