It was gathered that during the attack, many passengers were said to have been initially kidnapped, including Zamfara State former deputy Governor, Mallam Ibrahim Wakkala Liman. Others were shot dead and an unascertained number of the passengers also sustained various degrees of injury as a result of gunshots. The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, said that eight people were murdered in the terrorist attack. He disclosed that some of the passengers were still missing.
