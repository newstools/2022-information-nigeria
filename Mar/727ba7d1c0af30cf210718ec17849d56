Former President Goodluck Jonathan advised ECOWAS on Thursday in Monrovia to fully utilize technology in electoral processes in order to organize free and fair elections in member states. Jonathan delivered the suggestion while addressing as one of the panelists at the ECOWAS Parliament’s ongoing First Extra-Ordinary Session. The Communications Division of the Parliament quoted Jonathan as saying that citizens of the sub-region oftentimes lost confidence in their leaders who they believed to have manipulated the electoral system.
