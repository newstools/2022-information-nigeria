 Sex therapist and Kayamata seller, Hauwa Saidu Mohammed popularly known as Jaruma says actress Regina Daniels is yet to return her kayamata product. Regina Daniels was a brand ambassador for Jaruma. On November 3, 2021, the Nollywood star denied patronizing Jaruma’s kayamata. She claimed that their relationship was business-related as the latter only paid her to advertise her product. In a now- deleted Instagram post on Wednesday, the businesswoman claimed that Regina is yet to return her products after posting a video of the actress endorsing her brand. Reacting in the comment section of the post, an Instagram user @ Baddie_sharon_dc4life asked the kayamata seller if Reginal actually used her product. “Show me a lady as stubborn and a real definition of cruise and imma show you a Jaruma.
