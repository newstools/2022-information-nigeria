Former Anambra State governor Peter Obi has called on the Nigerian government to prioritize investment in education, noting that Ghana is doing well because of such investment. The former Anambra State governor who made the call in his keynote speech at the maiden education summit of the National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS), Enugu State, maintained that education, as the greatest asset of any nation, can help to boost the economy, build the social values of individuals, and achieve better governance in a nation. Citing examples with countries like China, India, Bangladesh and Ghana, which had similar low-ranking HDI with Nigeria in the year 2000, Obi said that these countries are now doing better than Nigeria because they have invested in the critical areas of development, of which education was the most important. Obi regretted that the government negotiates with bandits while lecturers on strike are ignored. “Professors, teachers and retired teachers are owed their due financial rewards while political leaders share and spend money on frivolities,” he said. “In the United States, for example, the governor of California earns about $200,000 while Stanford University professors earn about $300,000 each. This is because they understand that the professor is more valuable to society than many political leaders,” he added. Obi also blamed rising poverty and dearth of entrepreneurship in Nigeria on inadequate education, occasioned by the government’s apparent neglect of the education sector. In his words, “The progressive societies you see today are propelled by the private sector, the bedrock of which is entrepreneurship. Without proper education, it would be difficult for a nation to raise an army of entrepreneurs that will drive the economy.” Obi urged the government to invest aggressively in education so as to move the country forward.
