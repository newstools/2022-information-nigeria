President Muhammadu Buhari’s spokesman, Femi Adesina has said Nigerians would survive the current fuel scarcity. Adesina said heavens would not fall over the current fuel scarcity and Nigerians will survive like always. He stated this in his latest wee fekly article on Thursday titled “KNOCK, KNOCK. WHO’S THERE?” The presidential aide recalled that Nigerians had experienced a similar situation in the past and they survived. Adesina’s article reads partly: “It’s obviously not the easiest of times in our country currently, what with severe fuel scarcity exacerbating the other existential challenges we have been coping with. “In some areas, there’s no fuel, no electricity, thus translating to a severe energy crisis “There were cases of bad fuel before in this country. We slept for days, weeks on end at petrol stations, queuing for fuel. We survived. We will survive again. Las las.” Nigerians have been battling with fuel scarcity since February. The scarcity is said to have been caused by the importation of adulterated fuel. However, the Federal Government had assured Nigerians that normalcy would soon return because it has enough fuel.
