Veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo (RMD) has opened up on a pastoral call on his life which he has been running away from. He narrated how several persons always shared their dreams where they saw him as a pastor. RMD confessed to have wilfully avoided the pulpit for many years after having taught in Sunday school for over 15 years. The 60-year-old thespian asked fans to look out for him in the movie, “Cold” where he once again plays the character of a man of God. RMD wrote: “True Story! There was a time when for every other day or week, somebody would tell me they had a dream where they saw me as a pastor. Having taught Sunday school for over 15 years it was not far-fetched. “Besides every perceived Bad Boy is supposed to end up in full time ministry right? So, what did I do? Run! “I’ve avoided the pulpit with trepidation. But just like Jonah, I continue to end up somehow in the belly of the calling where I have played a pastor or reverend father more than anything else in my acting life. “Until date I still frighten myself every time I’ve had to speak in a church because when I take the pulpit, the Holy Spirit takes over. “And so once again I embark into a world of make believe where I play yet another man of God. I invite you on this epic cinematic journey into the spirit realm!”
