Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, the former Rivers State Governor, has admitted that he is afraid of the Governor of his home state, Nyesom Wike. Amaechi said during an interview with Channels Television when asked whether he would return to Rivers State to help his party, the All Progressives Congress, APC wrestle power from Wike 2023. After he was reminded that Wike has stamped his feet on the politics of Rivers and that charity begins at home, Amaechi said, “My eyes are here [in Abuja]. “This is my home now. Abuja is now my home and my governor is the minister of the FCT. I live and do business here.” Asked if he had any plans of going back to Rivers State, his local base, the Minister said, “When we reach the bridge we’ll cross it. For now, the FCT minister is my governor.” On whether he was afraid of Nyesom Wike, Amaechi said, “Yes. I’m very afraid of him. I’m very afraid. The interviewer probed further to know why the former Governor was afraid of his successor, to which Amechi replied, “Because I’m a ‘fear fear man’ now. What’s your problem? When we get to the bridge we’ll cross the bridge,” he said laughing.
