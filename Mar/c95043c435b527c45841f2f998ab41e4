The governor of Rivers stated that he believes the PDP will win the presidency in the next election. “If you’re running in an election, power isn’t given for free; it is taken. I have come out and I’m going to take this power from APC back to PDP by the grace of God,” he said. “God has given us what it takes.

I am declaring for the first time in Benue state because of my special relationship with them.

If you can’t protect life and property, then you can’t talk about governance. So, that major thing is that our people should be alive.” He also said disregard for the rule of law is affecting inflow of investment into the country. “Nobody can bring investment in this country because there is no respect for the rule of law. Nobody obeys court order. Who will come and invest his money when court gives its judgment and it will not be obeyed. So, I am going to run for election and victory will be ours,” he added.
