The Northern Youths Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to support former President Goodluck Jonathan for the presidency in 2023. Speaking on Arise Television on Saturday night, Isa Abubakar, NYCN president, said Jonathan has the strength to govern the country. The former president has not indicated interest to run for the position despite calls from different groups in the country. Abubakar described Jonathan as a “purposeful leader” who has the experience to take Nigeria to “the promised land”. “President Buhari should consider endorsing Jonathan if he is ready to contest the 2023 election. We are planning to mobilize ourselves to pay him a visit to consider running for the 2023 presidential election,” he said.
