Former Anambra State Governor Willie Obiano has been granted bail, according to Abdulrasheed Bawa, chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Obiano, who is being investigated for an N42 billion fraud, has been in EFCC custody since Thursday, when he was apprehended while attempting to leave for the United States at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos State.
