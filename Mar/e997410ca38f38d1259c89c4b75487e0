Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has appealed to stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress in the state, to accept the outcome of the just concluded national convention, by throwing their weight behind a former Governor of the State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, who emerged as the National Chairman of the party. This was contained in a statement signed and made available to journalists in Lafia on Thursday, by Governor Abdullahi Sule, through his Chief Press Secretary, Ibrahim Addra. He stated that he had observed unsavoury outbursts, bickerings, bitter exchanges and the use of foul and unprintable languages between the supporters of Adamu, and Al-Makura. The statement noted that, besides other aspirants from the North-Central geopolitical zone, Adamu had contested the APC top seat with another former governor of Nasarawa state, Senator Umaru Al-Makura, whose loyalists were not pleased with Adamu’s chairing of the party, thereby fanning the embers of discord in the state.

We should emulate them by making peace instead of bitter rivalry which is an ill-wind that blows no one any good.”
