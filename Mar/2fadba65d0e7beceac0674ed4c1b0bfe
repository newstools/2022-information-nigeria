Professor Emmanuel Osodeke, President of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), has indicated that nothing progressive has surfaced to bring an end to the body’s warning strike. The ASUU strike, now in its fourth week, is focused on the union’s demands for public university revival, earned academic allowances, renegotiation of the 2009 ASUU-FGN agreement, and discrepancies in the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System. Prof. Osodeke, who was a guest on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily show, stated his dissatisfaction with the current condition of affairs and the government’s failure to keep commitments made two years ago.
