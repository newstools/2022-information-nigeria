Professor Charles Soludo, Anambra State governor-elect will be sworn today as the sixth governor of the state. The Head, Soludo Media Office, Mr Joe Anatune, said the swearing-in of the Anambra State governor-elect would be low-keyed. In a statement in Awka on Wednesday, Anatune said the ceremony, which would take place at the Government House, Agu-Awka, would have few guests in attendance and devoid of unbridled celebrations that are usually associated with occasions of such nature.

The governor-elect, however, expressed gratitude to all for the outpouring of goodwill messages as well as the continuous support from well-wishers and numerous supporters within and across the globe.
