  Former Big Brother Naija Housemate Mercy Eke seemed to have abandoned her calling after giving a free show of her backside. Earlier this year, Mercy Eke said she had a dream where she was preaching the gospel and winning souls for God. However, it looks like Mercy Eke’s dream is one of those resolutions that come with the new year and people drops after a few months. In a video shared on her Snapchat, Mercy Eke was captured flaunting her backside repeatedly, and many fans have frowned over it. While some slammed Mercy Eke for lacking content and decency, others claimed her private parts no longer have privacy.
