How much more providing governance and leadership of a country as great, dynamic and complex as Nigeria? We know the crisis in APC today. “They will say ‘it is Abubakar Sani Bello today, tomorrow they will say it is Mai Mala Buni’. They are even confusing their supporters and members just the way they have succeeded in confusing the economy of this country. “I have said this somewhere else I will repeat it, the situation between President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigeria is like that of a forced marriage between a man and a woman. “There can hardly be understanding or peace. The president doesn’t understand Nigeria and the dynamics of modern governance.”
