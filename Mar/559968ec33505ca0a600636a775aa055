In her words: I have never attended a burial before. I will never attend one too, I said this when I was a child and I stick by it… My mom’s burial will/might be my first ever, to all my friends who think am shutting them out. My reason is I don’t attend burials, if I let you attend my moms, I will owe you the same favour and I can’t repay that. If you love me, pray for my family, if you intend to support me only pray for me. Don’t send a dime or consolation messages. I don’t do so well with that!! But know I appreciate you all a lot and am grateful.
