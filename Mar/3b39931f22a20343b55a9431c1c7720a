 The National leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu has donated one billion naira to Lagos State University (LASU), Ojo’s  Centre of Leadership Development.  The donation was confirmed by the LASU Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Ibiyemi Olatunji-Bello at the 25th convocation lecture of LASU on Thursday, according to Leadership Newspaper.  The theme of the Convocation Lecture was: “Global Trends: Nigeria and its Place in the World. Do We Love Ourselves Enough”.  Tinubu was represented at the event by Dr Obafemi Hamzat, Deputy Governor of Lagos State.  Speaking at event, Tinubu urged government support for strategic industries that would employ young people and unleash their productive capacity.  He said that government backing of strategic manufacturing and industries would open the door wider to youth-owned start-up businesses.  “National industrial and employment policies must jump from the pages of documents and come to real life.  “This will help to reform the society to improve the economic prospects of young people in it.  “We need a new more convivial way, a way that gives you the right start at a fair chance of durable prosperity.  “This is the moral duty of progressive government to resurrect a flagging economy; to do what the private sector can not do by itself,” Tinubu said.  He added that no longer should our national compass remain pointed towards poverty instead of prosperity and towards lack, instead of abundance.  “You graduates today should not live half lives or to subject your tremendous talents and aspirations to an economic condition that does not allow their full vent.  ” That you now graduate from this exemplar of learning and knowledge means the right answer is within you.
