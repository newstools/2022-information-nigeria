The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has stepped in to resolve a long-standing dispute between the Federal Government and tertiary institution unions, which has paralyzed activities in the country’s universities. As a result, the congress gave the government a 21-day deadline to resolve the issues with members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU), the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU), and the National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT) (NAAT). This was stated in a communique signed by NLC President Ayuba Wabba and the congress’ General Secretary, Emmanuel Ugboaja, on Wednesday in Abuja.
