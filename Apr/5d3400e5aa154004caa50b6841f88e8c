 A 27-year-old primary school teacher with a private nursery and primary school has been remanded for defiling his eight-year-old pupil in the school toilet on March 10, 2022. Earlier, the prosecutor, Bisi Ogunleye, told the Ogba magistrates’ court, Lagos, that the accused, Isaac Natu, lured the girl into the school toilet and had canal knowledge of her. Ogunleye further told the court that, “It was the school’s security guard who caught him in the act. He was apprehended and handed over to the police.” The magistrate, Mrs E. Kubeinje, who worried by the increasing cases of underage defilement did not take the plea of the accused and ordered that he be remanded and adjourned the case to April 27.
