Between six months and one year of occupying the office of Governor of the State, the militancy reduced tremendously. “Schools were opened, market women were able to go back to the markets, kidnapping reduced drastically and business returned. Foreign companies came back, Shell reopened, in fact by the time I was leaving, Total was trying to transfer their headquarters to Port Harcourt. Unfortunately when I left, they couldn’t manage it, so Total moved back to Abuja. But LNG returned their headquarters to Port Harcourt during my tenure as governor, Shell relocated their headquarters to Port Harcourt. “So we have experience, for somebody who has been in office for eight years as governor, eight years as speaker, seven years as minister, I chaired the Governor’s forum, I chaired the speakers forum, I also was the DG of the campaign of President Buhari twice.”
