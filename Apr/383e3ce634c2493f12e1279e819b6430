The Chinese government Embassy has denied backing the 2023 Presidential ambition of Rotimi Amaechi, the Minister of Transportation. Through its Embassy in Abuja, the Government described reports claiming it backed Amaechi’s presidential ambition as fake news. Some reports had it that the Chinese Government was backing Amaechi’s ambition. Reacting to the reports, the Embassy appealed to Nigerians to discard fabricated reports. A statement by the Embassy reads partly: “The attention of the Embassy of China has been drawn to a misleading report on an online news portal, alleging that Rotimi Amaechi, Hon. Minister of Transport of Nigeria and one of the aspirants to the 2023 Presidential Election, “has secured the backing of the Chinese Government”, and “…several meetings were held between Amaechi’s allies and the Chinese Government”, even claiming that ‘China needs to … install its dominance in Africa.’ “The general public is kindly reminded to ignore it and keep vigilant on this kind of fake news, which is fabricated with ulterior motives.” The Embassy said China’s diplomacy is built on mutual respect for other countries. It insisted that China respects Nigeria’s democratic political system. “With respect to Nigeria’s democratic political system, we are confident on the capacity of the Nigerian Government and people of organizing and conducting a successful general election,” it said. Amaechi recently declared his interest in running for the Presidency in 2023. Following his declaration, the Minister has been consulting with relevant stakeholders regarding his ambition. Meanwhile, Nigeria has been involved in a business arrangement with China, especially in the area of railways.
