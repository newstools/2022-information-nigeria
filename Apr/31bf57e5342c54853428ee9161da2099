Former governor of Edo, Adams Oshiomhole has stated that citizens should “harass” their governors to get education right. He made this suggestion while speaking on Thursday at an event in Abuja. Oshiomhole stated that the teachers in the schools are not giving their best because they are “hungry”. The event was organised by the Transforming D’ Intellectual Firmament of Africa-Community Development Initiative (TiFA-CDI) and Policy House International. The former governor said Nigerians should not be distracted by politics but ensure that their children get proper education.

We have a law that says if a child is not in school, the parents should be prosecuted,” he said. “That is the law of universal compulsory education, but as we speak, we have children who are being taught under the tree, that is if they are being taught at all. And we have teachers who can’t even spell their names and they can only spread illiteracy. “It is about harassing, engaging, terrorising and if I may quote Obasanjo, even behaving like a rebel to force governors and governments to get priorities right with regards to education. “It is not possible for us to boast of the ultra-modern government house but the most dilapidated schools and even to employ teachers and not pay them. “You have angry and hungry people in the classroom. They can’t be nice to our children and when they show no kindness to those children, those children grow up without care, without feeling, believing that the society is uncaring.”
