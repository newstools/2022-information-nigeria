 Nigerian rapper Erhiga Agarivbie, profoundly called Erigga, has countered the general meaning of ‘side chick’ in his social media post. A side chick is widely believed to be mistress; a woman one dates besides one’s girlfriend or wife, usually in secret, but according to the rapper, this definition is wrong for ‘girlfriends’ who are not married women. In his words; “A side chick is a girl who’s dating someone’s husband, not a girl dating your boyfriend. Girls who are dating your boyfriend are not side chicks, they are his girlfriends just like you too 🤔!!!!!”
