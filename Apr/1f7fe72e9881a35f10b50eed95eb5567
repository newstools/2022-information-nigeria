Yahaya Bello, the governor of Kogi State, has stated that he is unconcerned about former Lagos State governor and APC national leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, and other APC presidential hopefuls in the upcoming 2023 elections. Bello made the revelation in Abuja during his second annual seminar for political and crime correspondents, just 24 hours after expressing confidence that he would win the party’s presidential ticket. Despite the fact that Tinubu and other prominent figures were founder members of the APC, he believes that the foundation of a home is insufficient since other elements must be in place to build a house.
