Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the ruling All Progressives Congress’ National Chairman, has indicted governors in the ruling party’s crisis. Adamu said some APC governors were seeking to pull the party apart in his opening remarks at the APC’s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, which is currently taking place at the Transcorp Hotel in Abuja. Governors, according to Adamu, a former governor of Nasarawa, should seek to build the party in their states as leaders of the party.
