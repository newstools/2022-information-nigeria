He said the renegotiation commenced in 2017 when the federal government inaugurated a committee headed by Wale Babalakin, who was later replaced by Munzali Jibril, a professor. Ngige expressed that in the December 2020 agreement, he gave the government side a timeline to return to the university unions to sort out the pending issues. He added that the Nigerian university system produced him and he remains proud of it.
