Anyim Pius Anyim, a presidential hopeful running on the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) platform, claims that if he fails to perform after a year, he should be recalled. The former Senate President made the remarks while speaking to members of the PDP’s national working committee (NWC) at the party’s headquarters in Abuja on Wednesday. If elected president, Anyim claims to have the experience to lead the country to glory. “My experience is cognate; my capacity is proven; my nationalist disposition is established and my knowledge of our country is profound,” he said. “If you give me the ticket of our great party, I shall surely win the general election and return to government as president to continue the truncated good work PDP was doing for the country.

Let me say that my presentation is not a manifesto as I shall implement the party manifesto but my pathway to give meaning to our party manifesto. “We shall put the machinery in place to harvest the views and secure the buy-in of all components of our polity and build consensus on the structure of the federation, an acceptable governance system, benchmark agreed on a national aspiration to which all shall commit.”
