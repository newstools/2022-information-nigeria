 Former Big Brother Naija housemate, TBoss claims she is afraid of female house helps. According to the mother-of-one, no matter how good you treat them they will still show you “pepper.” Although the reality star didn’t reveal why she made the statement — it was from a personal experience or not, she only took to her Instagram stories to make the post. She wrote: “Housekeepers. “In Nigeria they are usually referred to as house girls, although I totally detest that word. “But yeah those girls “They are in a whole league of their own. “I fear who no fear house girls. “Look NO MATTER how good you are to them, They will still show you pepper. “It’s only a matter of time.” Recall that TBoss had questioned parents who put wigs and weave-ons on their kids. On her Instagram stories, she asked why kids not up to 5 years old are wearing wigs. TBoss went on to question if she is the only one who feels it’s not appropriate.
