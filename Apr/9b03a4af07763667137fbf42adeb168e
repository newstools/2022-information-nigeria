 A trigger-happy policeman, on Sunday, shot dead two persons at the venue of a party which was organised at La Silva Bar in Gowon Estate, Egbeda, Lagos. The incident brought to an end the birthday party as those in attendance fled for fear of arrest. It was learnt that the policeman was drunk, but that took to his heels on realising the enormity of what he had done. The spokesman of the police in the state, Benjamin Hundeyin, said the command was on the trail of the policeman. He said, “I can confirm there was a shooting at the bar on Sunday night and two persons were killed. We are investigating the circumstances that led to the shooting. I can assure you that those responsible will not go free. They will face the music. The commissioner of Police Lagos State, CP Abiodun Alabi, has zero-tolerance for such behaviour and has already given marching orders to the DPO to fish out the culprits.” It was also gathered that the celebrant identified as Ifeanyi alias Asiwaju of Computer Village, invited the policeman to provide security at the party. A Twitter user, @themannaman, who shared gory videos of the incident, wrote: “Some policemen called for security were the same people that shot and killed those they were called to protect…Nigeria, which way? “Birthday celebrant invited the police for security. The said policeman allegedly while drunk wanted to shoot upwards, then accidentally shot at them.”
