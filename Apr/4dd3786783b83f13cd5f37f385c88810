Bola Tinubu, a presidential candidate, claims he does not have a son old enough to run in the 2023 election. The remark occurred just hours after Vice President Yemi Osinbajo announced his candidacy for president. Tinubu met with 12 APC governors in Abuja shortly after Osinbajo proclaimed his presidential ambition.
