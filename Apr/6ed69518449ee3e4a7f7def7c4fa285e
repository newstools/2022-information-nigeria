He said that other countries with similar curricula to Ukraine have offered Nigerian students, whose programmes were interrupted by the Russia-Ukraine Conflict admission, to complete their studies either online or physically. According to him, all admission processing will be conducted through the Nigerian missions to authenticate students who were previously enrolled in various programmes in Ukraine. He said Nigeria still maintains good diplomatic standing with Russia in spite of its condemnation of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine.
