For slapping Chris Rock after the comedian made a joke about his wife, Jada at the Oscars award in March, Will Smith was banned. The decision was announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) on Friday. Will Smith in a brief statement, told Page Six that he accepts the decision. His terse statement read, “I accept and respect the Academy’s decision.” However, the award for Best Actor was not withdrawn from him.
