Bola Tinubu, a presidential hopeful, has urged the Lagos State House of Assembly to extend their Mecca prayers to the entire country beyond his 2023 aspiration. Tinubu made the remarks in a statement posted by his press office on Thursday. The former Lagos state governor is currently on a lesser hajj trip to Mecca. Mudashir Obasa, the speaker of the Lagos house of assembly, announced on Tuesday a “special Tawaf for Asiwaju,” which will “ask Allah’s favor and blessings for Asiwaju in the impending election.” The Tawaf is scheduled on Thursday at noon, and some members of the state assembly will pray around the Kaabah, which is located in the heart of the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Tinubu thanked lawmakers for the action and called it an “important decision” in response to the call for prayers in the statement.
