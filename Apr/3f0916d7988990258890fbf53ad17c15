Peter Obi, a presidential hopeful of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has stated that he is not yearning to be president, but rather keen to see Nigeria function when he assumes the reins of power. Obi, a two-term governor of Anambra State and the PDP’s vice presidential candidate in 2019 said this in Yenagoa on Wednesday when he paid a visit to Bayelsa State Governor Douye Diri.

The presidential hopeful, who compared the contribution of the agricultural value chain to Nigeria’s economy to oil income, condemned the country’s food production neglect.
