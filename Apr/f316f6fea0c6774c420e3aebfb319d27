 Nigerian talent manager, Tunji Balogun, popularly known as Teebillz has promised to organize a world tour featuring Burna Boy, Davido, and Wizkid, three of Nigeria’s most prominent Afrobeats artists. This was revealed on his Instagram page where he shared a picture collage of the three artists seeking for them to crush their egos while also stating how big a world tour would be with the three of them on board. While making his point known to his followers, Teebillz didn’t miss the opportunity to give credit to the pioneers as he called them while also chipping in the Afrobeats queens. “F$$k the egos my brodies! God blessed y’all as Afrobeats ambassadors for a reason! “It’s time to tour the world together in every stadium around the globe and stamp afrobeat as genre 4real! @burnaboygram @davido @wizkidayo “Shout out to the pioneers @official2baba @peterpsquare @iamkingrudy @iambangalee @donjazzy “Can you imagine an afrobeat world tour with our Queens too @tiwasavage @yemialade and @symplysimi may God so help me to make it happen! It’s Naija.” Recall the one time both Wizkid and Davido performed on the same stage and how hyped it left their fans. That shows how much of a great idea this would be if followed through till it happens.
