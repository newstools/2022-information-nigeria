The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has rebelled against the governor of Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, seeking a second term in office. The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos’ Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC) approved Sanwo-Olu for a second term in office on Monday. However, MURIC director Ishaq Akintola claimed in a statement that Sanwo-re-election Olu’s breaches the state’s rotational governance paradigm between Christians and Muslims. The support, according to Akintola, is “unfair and provocative,” and could lead to anti-APC protests until the problem is handled and resolved between Lagos Muslims and the state government. He said the Muslims’ objection was due to the fact that Christians have had their two terms in office as governors and it is the turn of Muslims to produce the next governor of the state.

It may not be known in official circles but Lagos Muslims are grumbling and we have been under pressure for some time now to speak up. “It is a dangerous dimension capable of eliciting protest bulk vote against the ruling party unless the issue is ironed out at a roundtable between leaders of the party, the Lagos State Government (LASG) and Lagos Muslims.”
