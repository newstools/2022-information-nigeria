 A groom’s best man has been arrested for allegedly stealing wedding gifts belonging to the bride worth N500,000 at Gaida area of Kumbotso LGA of Kano State. The incident happened a week after the wedding as the suspect was in possession of the house keys of the couple. According to Daily Trust, the vigilante commander of Gaida, Shekarau Ali, who confirmed the incident said the suspect got the keys from the relatives of the bride with the claim that he was going to hand them over to the groom.

Meanwhile, the suspect has confessed to the crime, stating that it was the devil that made him betray his friend and pleaded forgiveness.
