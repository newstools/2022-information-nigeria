Former Senate President Bukola Saraki believes it is now the north-central’s turn to govern the country. Saraki, a presidential aspirant, addressed delegates from Plateau’s Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Jos on Tuesday. The former governor of Kwara stated that the north-central has continuously helped other regions in leading the country and that it now expects the same support from other zones. “You remember that before the national convention of our party, we held a meeting in Abuja with delegates of north-central extraction,” Saraki said.

If given the chance, he claims he will lead an open administration that is transparent and fair to all Nigerians. According to the presidential hopeful, insecurity and other problems in Nigeria have gotten out of hand due to a lack of accountability among those in charge of dealing with them.
