Ayodele Fayose, former governor of Ekiti, has stated that he will not drop his presidential ambition for any politician in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Fayose spoke on Wednesday during an interview on Channels Television. Speaking during the programme, the former Ekiti governor stated that he has purchased the nomination form to contest for the PDP presidential ticket, adding that the PDP must zone its ticket to the south. “I don’t believe in not zoning this presidential ticket. I was a member of the zoning committee except for the last day that I picked up my form,” he said.

They never made that statement (on throwing the presidential ticket open). “Let me say to you, the only solution is zoning. The north can’t contest the last primary — the one we had in Port Harcourt which was an all northern affair — and come and tell us that there won’t be southern affair.” The former governor, however, said he will only accept the consensus option if he is nominated as the consensus presidential candidate.
