A group known as the Citizens Network for Peace and Development (CNPD) has stated that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will lose the presidency in 2023 if former President Goodluck Jonathan is not the flagbearer of the ruling party. Addressing a press conference in Abuja on Monday, Okorie Raphael, CNPD national coordinator, said Jonathan’s “acceptance” would enable APC to win the general election. Raphael stated that the comeback of the former president would provide a favourable environment for national engagement and dialogue.

As vanguards for Nigeria’s development, peace and unity, we want to reiterate that our beloved country cannot afford to have a regional champion as a flagbearer,” the coordinator said. “It is a thing of pride that a man of the calibre of Dr Abdullahi Adamu is the national chairman of APC. A man that has never lost an election, a man of strong character, a disciplined and astute administrator, a firm and focused leader and the man whose emergence further strengthened the party without a single defection as predicted by prophets of doom. “Therefore, it is imperative that Dr Aadmu will use the best man for the job to win this election bearing in mind that anything short of a GEJ ticket will cost APC the presidency in 2023.”
