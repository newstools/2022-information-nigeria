Shehu Sani, a former lawmaker, has expressed his disagreement with the Northern Elders Forum’s opinion that President Muhammadu Buhari should resign over the country’s security condition. The NEF had requested Buhari to quit on Tuesday, claiming that he had failed to secure the country. Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, the forum’s spokesperson, made the demand in a statement. It said it was unfortunate that Buhari, after nearly seven years in office, still has no answers to the country’s security concerns.
