The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, has stated that the mock Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME, will hold on Saturday across the country. The Registrar and Chief Executive Officer of JAMB, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, stated that all CBT centres should slightly increase their service charge to enable them offer reliable services. Oloyede stated that the initial amount permitted to be charged was N700, but due to the energy crisis, no centre should charge candidates above N1000.

Oloyede said: “Yes, we have allowed the accredited CBT centres, but we have hitherto asked the centres not to charge more than N700 naira, now we have seen the reality, and we said they could charge up to N1000. “So the reality is the truth, unless you don’t want them to conduct the examination, we have done the analysis of their expenses and if we insist they must put on their Airconditioners, it means the cost of generator or diesel has to be taken into consideration. We are not increasing our charges.”
