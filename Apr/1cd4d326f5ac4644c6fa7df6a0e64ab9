 According to reports, following the death of renown monarch, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, some mourners at the palace of the Alaafin of Oyo were on Saturday, attacked by bees. It was gathered that the attack occurred during the customary rites for the late king. Adeyemi, who was aged 83 at the time of his death, spent 52 years on the throne. The mourners were gathered in groups just outside the main palace area when the bees struck. The bees eventually left the area after hovering around the palace for about one hour. Meanwhile, the traditionalists who performed the burial rites for the Alaafin did not give any comment on if attack by bees had any significance.
