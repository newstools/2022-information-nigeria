Ben Ayade, the governor of Cross River, says he has informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his desire to run for the presidency on the APC platform (APC). He mentioned this during a meeting with Buhari on Tuesday while addressing with state house correspondents. He claimed that the president instructed him to consult with others about his plans. Ayade stated that if the APC zones the presidential ticket to the south, he will reproduce what he has done in Cross River, and that he has what it takes to continue from where Buhari will stop. Speaking on speculations on if former President Goodluck Jonathan may be chosen as the party’s candidate, the Cross River governor said he would be willing to step down his ambition and support Jonathan.

I believe that the party leadership will decide on the appropriate candidate that will take our party to victory,” he said. “And so, if you heard me well, I am just part of the family, absolutely loyal to the president, seeking to run for the president. And I am running. “But at any point in time that the political leadership of my party, the APC, feels that former President Jonathan is the appropriate candidate that will actually take us take us to victory, I will turn my support for him. “I am never, ever going to fight the establishment, the institution, the aristocracy, the spiritual vortex of which God has placed a leader of a country. I will never question the powers of the leader of a country. I have never played politics of antagonism or fight. “If you know how I became governor, I came governor by offering to support whoever the governor wants and by stroke of luck, I became the candidate. By the same token, I am only here to support the president’s candidate and by a stroke of luck, he said ‘you too, go there and join the race and let me see’.”
