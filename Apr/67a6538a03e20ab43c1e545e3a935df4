 Apostle Johnson Suleman, the senior preacher and founder of Omega Fire Ministry, has revealed why he did not consider Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, to be his spiritual father. In his address to his congregation, the clergyman said he neglected Adeboye as his spiritual father out of loyalty to the late Archbishop Benson Idahosa. According to him, his mindset changed after hearing Pastor Adeboye’s ministry and miracles. Suleman said: “Immediately they brought the mad man, he said to us, let’s worship ‘my daddy’; after the worship, the mad man got healed. The funny thing was Adeboye was very calm when saying this. I was just speechless because I never knew God’s plan for me through him. “After the program, I didn’t bother following him up because the late Benson Idahosa was my spiritual father in the lord, and I can’t betray him. My father in the lord died in 1998 in March, and I was now fatherless. So another crusade where over 4 million people (lekki 98) gathered, God used Pastor Adeboye greatly with the word of knowledge. I was still observing. “About 2006, I went into prayer, and something happened. I wrote names of pastors around the world that I wanted to be like. Funny enough, the late Benson Idahosa was number 10. God left others and answered the one about Pastor Adeboye. Why? I don’t stand in one spot while preaching, but pastor Adeboye stands in one spot. The holy spirit told me to pattern my ministry with Pastor Adeboye. I became calm while preaching because of Pastor Adeboye”.
