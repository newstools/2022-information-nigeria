National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, Iyorchia Ayu has lamented that Nigeria and Nigerians are now being physically cut off from each other by terrorists who have made it unsafe to traverse the country by road, rail and air. He disclosed this at Zaki-Biam, Ukum Local Government Area of Benue state, during the burial of a Speaker of the House of Representatives in the Second Republic, Benjamin Chaha on Thursday. This was contained in a statement signed late Thursday by the Special Assistant to the National Chairman on Communication and Strategy, Simon Imobo-Tswam. Ayu stated that a PDP Federal Government would rescue the country, reunite the people and put an end to the ongoing carnage. The statement was titled ‘We’ll re-unite Nigeria, end carnage, Come 2023 – Ayu’.

The new PDP government will do everything possible to make this carnage stops.”
