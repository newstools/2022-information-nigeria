The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), led by its President-General and Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar III, has advised Muslims across the country to seek for the new moon of Shawwal on Saturday as the 1443 Hijra (2022) Ramadan draws to a close. This was stated by the NSCIA’s Director of Administration, Arc. Zubairu Haruna Usman-Ugwu, in a statement issued on behalf of the Sultan on Friday. He said consequent upon the advice of the National Moon Sighting Committee (NMSC), the Sultan enjoined the Nigerian Muslim Ummah to search for the crescent of Shawwal 1443 AH immediately after sunset on Saturday, April 30th, 2022, which is equivalent to 29th Ramadan, 1443 AH.

However, if the crescent is not sighted that day, then Monday, May 2nd 2022, automatically becomes the day of ‘Idul Fitr.” “In addition to the established and traditional Islamic leaders in each locality, members of the NMSC can be contacted to report credible and positive sighting of the Crescent of Shawwal 1443 AH,” Usman-Ugwu said. He also urged Muslims to in the spirit of Ramadan, remember that Zakatul Fitr (special Ramadan charity) is a compulsory food-levy imposed on privileged Muslims, to be given to the less privileged in the society. He, therefore, urged all concerned to ensure that they do not only comply but comply on time.
