Yoruba actress and filmmaker, Bukunmi Oluwasina has stated that one of the grave mistakes a person can make is to be addicted to social media. The mother-of-one cautioned social media users against allowing themselves be taken over by this habit on her Instagram page. She revealed that there are a lot of things that can subconsciously mess with one’s minds from the various apps until “everything real and valuable around you is gone.” Bukunmi Oluwasina also added that most times, the addict is usually the last person to realise that he/she has been living life based off on information absorbed from social media and pictures painted thereon; pictures she added no one else cares about.
