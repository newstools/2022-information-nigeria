On the night of November 6, two acquaintances were arguing in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles, according to the LAPD. “The argument escalated and resulted in the suspect firing a handgun at the victim.

Following the shooting, the suspect and two additional males fled the area on foot,” police said. “The suspect has been identified as 33-year-old Rakim Mayers, a Los Angeles resident, also known as music artist A$AP Rocky,” according to police.

According to multiple reports, the rapper, who is the boyfriend of singer Rihanna, was returning to California from Barbados, where he was on vacation before his arrest.
