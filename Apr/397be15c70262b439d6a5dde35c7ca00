The federal government said on Tuesday that it had discovered 1,500 federal employees using forged employment papers while working in the system. Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan, the Federation’s Head of Civil Service, stated this in her keynote talk at the ‘National Policy Dialogue on Entrenching Transparency in Public Office Recruitment in Nigeria.’ The event was hosted in Abuja by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission. According to Yemi-Esan, the office was notified in March of last year of the discovery of false letters of employment submitted in several ministries. She said for instance, in the past year, in one ministry alone, over 1,000 individuals bearing fake letters of appointment were detected. Yemi-Esan said it was disheartening to point out that the office recently received a report from the Federal Civil Service Commission forwarding the names of over 500 people in various MDAs in possession of fake letters of appointment and which are to be delisted from the IPPIS platform. She added that following the outcome of the Service-Wide Verification Exercise for officers recruited from 2013 – 2020, the Federal Civil Service Commission had also requested the suspension of the salaries of over 3,000 officers across the MDAs who failed to appear for the exercise pending further clearance.
