People see the PDP as the only hope in Nigeria today,” Lamido said. “We look at what do we come up with and Nigerians will be comfortable with it and will give them the environment that will restore mutual love and trust for each other. “To me, before you do anything else, we need to restore the trust among ourselves. “Apparently, in Nigeria today, we don’t trust each other. We don’t believe in each other anymore. Our common bond is not there anymore. Our common bond is humanity.”
