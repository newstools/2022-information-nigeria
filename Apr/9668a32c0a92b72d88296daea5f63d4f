Funmi Awelewa also begged her concerned friends not to worry about her because she’s fine and fully concentrating on taking care of her sick mother. She wrote: “After this post, if you ask me about anything Walai, Epe lemagba. Cus I just started putting my life in shape. Last year was tough that I couldn’t attend a lot of event + locations. I didn’t see anyone, I was all alone with my predicament. I spent more than I earned on hospital bills and drugs yet I’m still smiling. Only few colleagues/friends reach out to my family. I’m grateful God didn’t put us to shame. “For the record, I’m not in any abusive relationship and I can never lower my standard for such. I’m not worthless, classless and trust me, no man can turn me to an object of ridicule. If such happens, I will opt out without thinking twice.
Please, Edakun, enough of ngbatingbati… I need full concentration to take care of this old woman. Don’t stress me with “Are you sure?”Feel free to believe whatever you read and leave me alone. Eseun!!!🙏🏼  “ Funmi Awelewa  further added this cryptic message below:Recall that Nollywood actress, Yewande Adekoya-Abiodun’s marriage of 8 years hit the rocks due to infidelity on the part of the husband, actor and producer, Ishola Abiodun and continuous infliction of emotional abuse on the actress.
