Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka questioned President Muhammadu Buhari’s choice to select Iyiola Omisore as the APC’s new National Secretary last Saturday. Mr. Omisore, according to the Nobel laureate, is still a primary suspect in the unsolved murder case of former Attorney-General and Minister of Justice Bola Ige. Soyinka highlighted in a statement titled ‘Perhaps Closed Files Should Remain Just That – Closed?’ that there was a continuing vow to reopen the files on the present administration’s spate of unsolved political assassinations.
