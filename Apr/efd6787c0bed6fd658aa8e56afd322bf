Popular Ghanaian actress, Yvonne Nelson has shared her thoughts about flaunting one’s relationship on the internet. Giving her two cents on the matter, the actress opined that such actions usually make the relationship end quicker. Giving her opinion via her verified Twitter account, the screen diva noted that once a person starts to show off their relationship on social media, people begin to meddle in their private lives. She said, “My observation… a relationship will end if it has to but flaunting it on social media just speeds up the process (all the side chicks will come flying around and the gossip association will hold their weekly meeting for your sake) happy weekend guys.” Asides from being an actress, Yvonne Nelson is also a model, film producer and entrepreneur. A former Miss Ghana contestant, she accidentally began her career when she went to her favourite place to watch an audition and the producer urged her to perform but she refused. The producer later got her number, called several times before she agreed and feature in her first movie role in Princess Tyra in 2007. She later delved into movie production in 2011. Her first production was the movie The Price, which was released that same year. On October 29, 2017, Nelson gave birth to her daughter Ryn Roberts with her ex-boyfriend, Jamie Roberts. The actress remained silent about the rumours of her pregnancy until she announced the birth of her daughter through a WOW Magazine Cover.
