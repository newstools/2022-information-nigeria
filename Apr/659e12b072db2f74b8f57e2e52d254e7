 Years after splitting from former bbnaija housemate, Ike Onyema has thrown shade at a woman he dated. Recall that Ike is a former Big Brother Naija reality star, who dated co-star Mercy Eke in the Big Brother Naija house and had a break-out reality show with her after they left the house. However the break-out reality show was short-lived as the pair’s love relationship crashed soon after. Today Ike took to TikTok to share a video where he referred to himself as a “big fool.” The caption on the post reads: “When I remember how I tried to change a ho3 into a housewife.” See video below
