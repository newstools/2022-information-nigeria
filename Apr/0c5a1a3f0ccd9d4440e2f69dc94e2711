On Thursday, President Muhammadu Buhari urged Nigerians not to give up in the face of the country’s difficult difficulties. Buhari voiced confidence in Nigeria’s ability to overcome current insecurity and uncertainties in his Easter message to Nigerians in 2022. He urged Nigerians to continue to love one another, avoid hatred, and be patriotic for the sake of the country’s larger welfare. “Easter evokes in us the resilience of the human spirit not to give up in the face of seemingly daunting challenges of life,” Buhari remarked.

The President also urged Nigerians, in the spirit of the season, to demonstrate ”love for one another, rather than hate – and show more patriotism, as this is the only country we have”. “I enjoin us, therefore, to live out the eternal words of Jesus Christ on the cross where he said, ‘‘Father, forgive them for they know not what they are doing.’’ “Let us remember that the scriptural emphasis of love has so much relevance for us today as a nation more than ever before,’’ Buhari adjured.
