Former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, says Nigerians don’t need a consensus presidential candidate to manage the country, but rather a “problem solver.” Obi, a presidential candidate for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), addressed journalists on Tuesday during a consultation meeting with party members in Ebonyi state. The sentiments of consensus candidates, according to Obi, should not be brought to the forefront at this point in the country’s political history. He added that a candidate’s geopolitical zone should not be a consideration because “what Nigeria needs is to save the country.” Obi described himself as someone who can fix the country and make it progressive.
