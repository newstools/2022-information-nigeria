 Weeks after the death of gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, Nollywood actress, Victoria Inyama has opined that Peter Nwachukwu, the husband and prime suspect in her demise is going to walk scot-free. Victoria made the assertion on Instagram on Wednesday after police revealed why Mr Nwachukwu has not been arraigned. Recall that the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba on Wednesday said Osinachi’s husband will be charged to court after the autopsy result of the late singer is out. The IGP said this when the Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Tallen visited him at the Force Headquarters. Reacting to the statement, Victoria on Instagram said he’ll go scot-free due to a lack of tangible evidence and ‘rubbish’ judiciary system. Her post read, “I believe it is the beating (kick to the chest) and trauma over the years as he took her to the hospital then evaded a crime. “That man is going to walk free as usual. Lack of tangible evidence, Rubbish judiciary. Just a very sad case.”
