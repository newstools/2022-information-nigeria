Minister of Foreign Affair, Geoffrey Onyeama, has expressed concern over the state of security in Nigeria. He urged Nigerians to do away with religion and communal beliefs that have become tools of manipulation and conflict in society. The minister disclosed this on Tuesday when he spoke alongside other stakeholders, during the opening of the National Policy Roundtable on the Network of Policy Makers to support reconciliation, peace and security in Nigeria.

He noted that in the political history of post-independence, Nigeria was awash with tragic instances of violent conflict and acrimony that had erupted as a result of the manipulation of religion and other identity markers such as the ethnic market.
