The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has warned Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and a Presidential aspirant to steer clear of the Southeast. IPOB stated that Wike denied having any links with the Southeast in the past, hence should keep off the region as he tries to canvas for votes. Emma Powerful, the spokesman of IPOB, issued the warning while condemning Wike’s recent visit to the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Alfred Achebe on Wednesday.
