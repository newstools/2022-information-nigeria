 Jedidah Shola, mother to fantastic singer Simi, speaks on husband and wife loving and treating each other with respect. Jedidah, in her Twitter post on Monday, April 11, 2022, advised social media commentators to stop saying that husbands need respect while wives need love. She countered the opinion that all human beings need love and respect from their spouses. Jedidah then preached; “please let’s stop this noise of husband needs respect and wife needs love. Show me one human being who doesn’t need respect and love from his or her spouse.” Please let's stop this noise of husband needs respect & wife needs love. Show me one human being who doesn't need respect & love from his/her spouse. Let all couples learn to treat each other with respect & love. Don't give your spouse what you cannot accept. — Ayanfe Eledumare (@Jedishola) April 11, 2022  “Let all couples learn to treat each other with respect and love. Don’t give your spouse what you cannot accept.” It is won’t be wrong to say Simi’s mother spoke from experience because she walked down the aisle for the second time in year 2018 after splitting from her first husband in 1997.
