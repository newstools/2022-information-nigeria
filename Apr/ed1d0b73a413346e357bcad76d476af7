 Nigerian movie producer, Kemi Adetiba, and Oscar Heman-Ackah, the Ghanaian music executive, have tied the knot. The couple had their introduction and court wedding in the Ikoyi axis of Lagos state on Friday. Sharing a loved-up photo of herself and Oscar via Instagram, she accompanied it with a terse caption: “Officially official!!!” The event was graced with the presence of their friends and family members. The filmmaker had disclosed that Oscar proposed to her in January at a surprise party while they were away in Ghana, and had announced her engagement to the entrepreneur in February. Good luck to them.
