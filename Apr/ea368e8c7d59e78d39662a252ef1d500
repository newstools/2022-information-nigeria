Human rights lawyer, Mike Ozekhome has stated that President Muhammadu Buhari erred in law by granting pardon to Joshua Dariye, former governor of Plateau state, and Jolly Nyame, former governor of Taraba state. Nyame is serving a 12-year jail sentence for diverting N1.64 billion during his tenure as governor of Taraba, while Dariye is serving 10 years imprisonment for N1.126 billion fraud. The former governors were among 159 inmates pardoned at a council of state meeting on Thursday. They were granted pardons on the grounds of age and ill-health. Ozekhome faulted the decision of the council in a statement issued on Saturday, noting that the president acted beyond his constitutional powers. Ozekhome stated that since the offences were committed against states, it lies in the hands of the state governors to grant them a pardon.
