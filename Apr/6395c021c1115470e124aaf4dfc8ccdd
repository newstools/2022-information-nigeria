 Big Brother Naija Star, Angel Smith has broken silence after Skitmaker Ashmusy’s mum cited her as a bad example. Recall that Ashmusy’s mother, in a lengthy message while reprimanding her daughter for getting her nose pierced, said she was turning into BBN’s Angel, and she disapproves of it. Angel’s mom, in a post via her Instastory, questioned why Ashmusy’s mum didn’t see the size of her daughter’s backside but chose to call hers out over a nose piercing. Reacting, Angel reached out to her mum on Instagram and urged her to delete the instastory post about Ashmusy’s mum. Angel wrote; “Bae delete, it’s okay” The Reality star’s mum replied; “Anything for you my baby” SEE POST BELOW
