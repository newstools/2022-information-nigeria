 In an Instagram on Thursday, the on-air personality said that the devil does not destroy marriages.  “Dear K3na and Nigerians Christians. The devil does not destroy marriages; the devil did not destroy a single marriage in the entire Bible, read for yourself to verify. So please, stop blaming the devil for our personal errors and shortcoming,” he wrote.
