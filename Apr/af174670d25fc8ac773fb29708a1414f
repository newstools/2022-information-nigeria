Senator Kabiru Gaya of Kano South has been named chairman of The Progressive Project (TPP), an umbrella organization of support groups for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo‘s presidential candidacy. Gaya told a press conference in Abuja on Thursday that Osinbajo’s desire is a response to “populist calls” from a citizen-driven mobilization, not a personal one. Senator Bukola Saraki believes Osinbajo will succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. “Without an iota of doubt, I am certain that all the knowledgeable people here can attest to the qualities and competence of Professor Yemi Osinbajo,” the TPP chairman said.
