 Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie’s second wife, Judy Austin, has reacted after the actor shared a photo of his first wife, assuring her that she’s his number one. After unveiling Judy as his second wife on Wednesday, Yul on Thursday hailed his first wife, May, via an Instagram post. He assured her that she’s the number woman in his life and that no one will ever take that place. “NUMBER ONE.  @mayyuledochie.
