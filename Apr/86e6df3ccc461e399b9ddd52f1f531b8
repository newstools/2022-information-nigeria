On Thursday, the Federal High Court in Abuja dismissed a complaint seeking to declare Cross River State Governor Ben Ayade‘s seat empty. Justice Taiwo Taiwo referenced an Enugu Court of Appeal decision that stated that defection is not a reason for removal from office. The dismissal of a sitting governor and his deputy can only be done in accordance with constitutional laws, according to the Justice.
