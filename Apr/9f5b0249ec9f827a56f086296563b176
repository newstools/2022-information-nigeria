A man from the northern part of Nigeria, Abubakar has threatened to take his own life if Nigeria’s minister of transportation, Rotimi Amaechi fails to contest in the 2023 presidential election. The man took to Twitter to make the threat. He wrote: I have been reading bad news about Amaechi not interested in becoming our next president. I hope it‘s not true. I pray it‘s fake news. Cos I can‘t entangle myself with the fact that our best minister and the only one who can consolidate Buhari‘s achievements; the only one I know of who can end insecurity and promote justice and fairness is not interested in serving his fatherland despite our call. Amaechi, this is not fair if it‘s true. And mark this, I will commit suicide if you fail to contest for Nigeria‘s president because you are the only one we trust.
