Governor Ikpeazu praised Rivers Governor Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as the greatest candidate the PDP can support in 2023. He said this at a meeting between Wike and the party’s National Working Committee on Tuesday.

Governor Wike, who was also accompanied by the former Governor of Gombe State, Hassan Dankwambo, asked the party not to be sentimental in their candidate selection process.
