The ex-president said, “You are calling me to come and declare for the next election. I cannot tell you I’m declaring. The political process is ongoing, just watch out. “The key role you must play is to pray that Nigeria gets somebody that carries the young people along; somebody that can also work very hard to see that some of the problems are addressed by the government and I believe collectively, we will work together.”
