 Legendary Nigerian singer 2face Idibia has blasted the current administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari for poor performance. In a post shared on his Instagram story, 2face said that since other political office holders claim Buhari is solely responsible for the whole problem in Nigeria, everyone in public office should resign — from the governors to the local government chairmen. 2face said it is necessary they resign since they do not have anything to contribute to the country’s growth because the current administration’s shamelessness is beyond comprehension. See post below: Recall that 2Face Idibia has continued to eulogize his wife, Annie Idibia. Annie and 2Face had been in the news lately due to the Netflix reality TV show, Young, Famous and African which has been trending.
