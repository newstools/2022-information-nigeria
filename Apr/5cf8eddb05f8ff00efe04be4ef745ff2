Ebonyi State Governor and presidential hopeful, Dave Umahi, has denied dropping his ambition of succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari for the Senate come 2023. He described the claims suggesting that he had backed out of the race for the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as senseless, malicious, and cowardly fabricated falsehood peddled by some mischievous persons. The Commissioner for Information and Orientation in Ebongi, Uchenna Orji, made this known in a statement on Tuesday in Abakaliki, the state capital.

Orji, who described the sponsors of the rumour as political jobbers, stated that they were being monitored and would be made to face the full wrath of the law. He stressed that Governor Umahi’s presidential ambition was unwavering and alive in the hearts of Nigerians.
