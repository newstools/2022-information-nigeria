 A lady identified as @BriEsquire on Twitter has narrated how she was added to a group chat by the wife of a married man whom she exchanged contacts with. According to Bri, the woman added the side chicks of her husband to a group chat so they can discuss about her husband. Bri tweeted, “Met a man named Drew like 3 days ago. We exchanged numbers. This morning I woke up in a group chat, started by his alleged wife, with 8 other women. It’s been comedy and chaos ever since. Y’all. He got five kids 😭 The woman who started the chat didn’t tell us she was his wife at first but then some of the other girls in the chat started putting two and two together and it all just went downhill from there 😭 Apparently one of Drew’s coworkers was added to the chat so she started exposing the alleged wife, saying how they are separated now and she should stop the mess. Another girl was texting Drew on the side and shared screenshots of Drew asking to be added to the chat😂😂. I guess he wanted to defend his honor.”
