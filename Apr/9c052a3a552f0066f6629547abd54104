Orji Uzor Kalu, the Senate Chief Whip, has announced that he will not run for the All Progressives Congress presidential ticket. He announced his decision in a statement on his verified Instagram page on Tuesday, explaining his reasoning. Kalu, a two-term governor of Abia State, said that entering the contest without the complete support of other areas was pointless. He claims that four of the country’s six geopolitical zones, excluding the South East and North East, have produced the President and Vice President at separate periods.

In the midst of calls for the ticket to be allocated to the South, he believes that now is the time for regional leaders to rally behind the South East to produce the next President. If such is the case, he continued, the next Nigerian leader would no longer be unfair and unjust if he emerged from Daura, the President’s hometown. After withdrawing from the presidential contest, Kalu stated that he would focus his efforts on returning to the Senate at the conclusion of the 9th National Assembly.
