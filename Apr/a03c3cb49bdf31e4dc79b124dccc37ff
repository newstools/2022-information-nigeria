Mrs. Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, the wife of the Ondo State Governor, has entered the Senate race for 2023. The Ondo First Lady told journalists in Owerri, the capital of Imo State, on Friday that she is interested in representing the Imo East Senatorial District because she wants to make a difference. Mrs. Akeredolu told members of the Nigerian Union of Journalists’ (NUJ) Correspondents’ Chapel in Owerri that the Owerri West senatorial zone has had the worst representation in recent years. She said that successive Imo state administrations had neglected the zone, and that she was out to make up for the years consumed by locusts.
