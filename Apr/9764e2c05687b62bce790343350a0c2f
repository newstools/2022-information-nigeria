 Billionaire heiress and singer, Florence Otedola, better known as DJ Cuppy, has reacted after a curious fan asked her about her relationship status. The fan, identified as Asacha Michael, asked Cuppy to show the world her man, or else he’d conclude that her relationship with her dogs, Dudu and Funfun, is far deeper than she portrays. He wrote, “DJ Cuppy, show us your man or we assume #d0ggy.” Recall that dogs became a trendy topic on Twitter on Friday, April 29 after a Twitter user alleged that some ladies in Lagos were sleeping with dogs for N1.5 million. The user with the handle @Justkingss took to his page to make the claim and also attached video evidence to the tweet. However, on seeing the fan’s tweet, Cuppy responded by saying she’s single and her type is “human.” ”I am SINGLE and my type is the HUMAN SPECIES  #CuppyDat”, she replied. See their exchange below,  Meanwhile, a while ago, Cuppy declared that her dogs would determine who she would date next. According to the singer, if her ‘sons’, Dudu and FunFun doesn’t like a prospective suitor, then there’s no way they can date. “Have you met my 3 month-old Pomeranian sons @DufuPoms?  If Dúdú and FünFün don’t like you, we can’t date “, she said.
