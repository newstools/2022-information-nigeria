The current security difficulties in Nigeria, according to Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila, are a threat to the country’s nationhood. Gbajabiamila, on the other hand, stated that the Nigerian government has responded to the difficulties by increasing funds for the police and military, as well as hiring employees for security organizations. The Speaker said this in a paper he delivered at the School of Oriental Studies London on Wednesday, which was titled titled ‘Democracy in Challenging Times: The Role of African Parliaments in Safeguarding and Delivering on the Dividends of Democracy,’ as part of his ongoing official visit to the United Kingdom.

However, we cannot do this for as long as our present national security challenges persist. “The government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has responded to the reality of our present challenges by increasing funding provisions for the police and armed forces, accelerating recruitment and training to put more boots on the ground, and also acquiring weapons systems designed to give the security agencies an advantage.”
