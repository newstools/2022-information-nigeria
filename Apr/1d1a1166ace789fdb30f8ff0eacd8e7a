Presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, on Friday, admitted that Nigeria is at war. Adesina, in a piece titled, ‘They Hate God, They Loathe Humanity’, described the attack by terrorists on hundreds of passengers onboard an Abuja-Kaduna train on Monday as a “carnage” and a “premeditated murder from the very bottom of hell”. He said, “Whoever or whatever they are, terrorists, bandits, it doesn’t matter. They sow evil, and they will reap it. They do not deserve to live. Not in this world, nor the next. They need to be sent to their master, the Devil, and speedily too.” Also Read: Kaduna Train Attacks: Things Buhari Must Do To End Insecurity – Saraki Adesina lamented that the terrorist attacks on trains was affecting the “rail revolution in the country” and that the insurgents abhor any form of progress or development. He said though his principal, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), won’t be able to carry weapons to face the marauders like he did when he was much younger as a military officer, he had ordered the Service Chiefs, and the Inspector General of Police to “wipe out these evil people. Kill them. Eliminate them.” The presidential aide also blamed Nigerians for the insecurity in the country, saying they perpetuate evil through negative comments.
