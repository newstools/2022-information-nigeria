Prior to Yul’s revelation, Judy had managed to keep her head low and private affairs off social media. Hence, asides being a Nollywood actress and movie producer, little is known about the light-skinned thespian. Reports say a certain friend, actor and movie director, Sylvester Madu urged Judy to give acting a try on account of her good looks. She did and the rest, as they say, is history.
