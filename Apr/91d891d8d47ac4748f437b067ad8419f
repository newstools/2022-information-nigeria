President Muhammadu Buhari feels that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) developmental initiatives are sufficient reasons for Nigerians to vote for the party in next year’s general elections. He announced this on Thursday at the State House in Abuja, where he received Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the new APC National Chairman. “Today, we should all be happy that the party has nursed its wounds and healed itself sufficiently to march forward to face the challenges of the coming state and General elections,” the President said, according to a statement by his media aide, Garba Shehu.
