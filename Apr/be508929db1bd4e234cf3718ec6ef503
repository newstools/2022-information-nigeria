Four members of the Rivers State Government’s cabinet have reportedly left their posts in order to run for governor in 2023. Though no formal statement confirming their resignations was issued, it is speculated that they resigned to avoid a stipulation in the Electoral Act of 2022 that requires political appointees to depart office in order to participate in party primaries. Dr Tammy Danagogo, the Secretary to the State Government, Isaac Kamalu, the Commissioner for Finance, Boma Iyaye, the Commissioner for Sports, and George Kelly, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Special Projects, are among those who have resigned.
