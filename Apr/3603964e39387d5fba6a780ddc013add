Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the governor of Lagos State, has told presidential hopeful Rotimi Amaechi that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s aspiration remains the “rallying point” of Lagos. Sanwo-Olu made the remarks while meeting with the Minister of Transportation in Marina, Lagos, yesterday. Both Amaechi and Tinubu, the former governor of Lagos, are candidates for the presidency in the All Progressives Congress. Sanwo-Olu, who described himself as a “direct beneficiary” of Tinubu’s leadership, stated that the state would back Tinubu in his bid for the presidency in 2023. He did point out, though, that Amaechi was also qualified.

I have been a direct beneficiary of his leadership. I have been part of his cabinet,” he said. “Personally I continue to tow that line of leadership and what he stands for.” “I want to say to you that you’re eminently qualified and I want to wish you well in this journey. Clearly, for all of us in Lagos State, Asiwaju continues to be our rallying point, but the country is our country and we must continue to see it as the one that is indivisible and one that we all rally around. “I certainly know too well what your pedigree is and what you have done,” the governor said.
