Former Governor of Bayelsa State and Senator representing Bayelsa West, Seriake Dickson, has warned mischief makers against instigating needless division in the Peoples Democratic Party in the state. He warned politicians who were out to cause disaffection among the leadership of the party over issues clearly not unconnected with the 2023 general elections to desist forthwith. He enjoined them to remember the mercy and grace of God which blessed the party’s joint effort to retrieve its stolen mandate, based on the effort led by him to midwife the advent of the current administration.
