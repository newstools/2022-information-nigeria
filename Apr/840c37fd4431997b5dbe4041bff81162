Omoyele Sowore, a human rights activist and convener of Revolution Now, was granted freedom of movement by an Abuja Court of Appeal on Wednesday. Following charges of treasonable crime and cyberstalking President Muhammadu Buhari, Sowore was limited to Abuja by a Federal High Court in 2019. Sowore can now leave Abuja but not leave Nigeria, according to the Appeal Court. The court found the prohibition on the 2023 presidential candidate’s travel to Abuja to be “excessive,” and hence lifted it.
