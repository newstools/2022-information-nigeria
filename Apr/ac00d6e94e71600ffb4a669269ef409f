He is so unpredictable that you cannot predict what he will do. He might pull anybody by surprise anytime,” he said. “That gives him the military training that he has. Anybody (referring to presidential hopefuls) that meets him, whatever he says to A, the same thing he will say to B. “If anybody comes out to say, Buhari has endorsed him, the person will not be saying the truth. The president may have his preferred candidate in his chest. He has not made that known to anybody. “The President Buhari, I know, will want to check the mood of the nation.
