Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, has said the criticism issued by the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, concerning the state pardon granted by President Muhammadu Buhari to a former Governor of Plateau, Joshua Dariye, and his Taraba State counterpart, Jolly Nyame, lacked moral justification. Wike had criticised the state pardon, saying it ridiculed the judiciary which had convicted both men of corruption. The presidential hopeful, who spoke in Minna on Saturday, where he met with delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party, lamented that the Buhari administration is selective in its war against corruption.

This did not do. A press release after the meeting is bolekaja politics,” Shehu said.
