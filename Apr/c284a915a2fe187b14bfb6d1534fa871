Cross River State Governor Ben Ayade claimed on Thursday that Nigeria’s massive solid minerals resource is drawing terrorists to the country. “Security has a very huge international dimension,” Ayade stated on Channel Television’s Sunrise Daily on Thursday morning. “Nigeria has so many essential elements and metals of economic interests. So, the solid minerals deposit has become a source of challenge to the nation. “Nigeria has a large deposit of tantalite, they have led, they have zink, they have gold, uranium, the deposits are so huge.
