 Veteran thespian Shan George recounted how financial issues almost prompted her to take her own life. The Nollywood actress, who spoke in a recent interview with Chude Jideonwo, said she went broke to the point of selling her valuables when her mother fell ill in 2011. She said; “My mum fell ill in 2011. It became so bad. it wasn’t letting me sleep. As if that wasn’t bad enough, my rent had expired. I had to sell some of my cars and jewelry. I was selling some of my valuables to raise money for her hospital bills. I went back to Calabar.” “They were asking what I was going to be doing. That night, I cried till morning. I thought that was the end for me.” “When I was suicidal, I was so broke one day. One of my visitors brought this shaving powder. I wanted to put it in water and drink it. I told my mother I was going to kill myself as I was tired and frustrated”. “My mum said, ‘okay, you’re not going alone. Bring it. We’re going together. It was at night and I was happy. I took it to her and was thinking that the two of us would just go quietly because this life is tiring. I won’t lie”.
