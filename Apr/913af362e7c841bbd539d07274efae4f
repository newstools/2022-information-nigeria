Afenifere leader, Ayo Adebanjo has stated that if the office of the presidency was based on “merit”, only candidates from the south-east will hold the office “till kingdom come”. Adebanjo said this on Monday in his remarks at the ‘Greater Nigeria Conference’ organised by the Nzuko Nmunna, an Igbo think-tank. The focus of discussions at the conference was on the need to support a candidate from the south-east in the 2023 general election. Adebanjo stated that it’s the turn of the south-east to produce the next president in the interest of fairness and equity.

If it was based on merit, till today, till kingdom come, the east alone will produce president. “I am saying all these to tell you that the question of lobbying, campaigning is rigmarole. They know the truth. “For the fact that they’re saying you have no people, I’m happy you have demonstrated that you do. But you must go and unite. You must be united. A house divided against itself will not stand.”
