Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti, visited Rotimi Akeredolu, his Ondo state counterpart, on Tuesday to seek advice on his presidential bid. Fayemi, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is yet to formally declare his interest. In January, the Ekiti governor raised an alarm over the plot of some persons in the APC to “de-market him as the 2023 presidential election draws near”. Fayemi, who is the chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), met with Akeredolu at the exco chambers of the governor’s office in Ondo state. He stated that he was in the state to consult with the governor ahead of the APC presidential primary election.
