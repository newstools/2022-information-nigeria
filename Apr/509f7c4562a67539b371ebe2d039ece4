Nigerian skit maker Lasisi Elenu has disclosed he was pursuing a career in music alongside skit making at the inception of his comedy career. Lasisi, christened Nosa Afolabi, said he saw social media as an avenue for him to express himself rather than make money. He started that he saw the internet as a platform to become famous, and he tapped into it. While making music, Lasisi revealed he saw comedy skit making as another way of being famous in Nigeria, which eventually worked for him. Since had already achieved what he wanted with music in skit making, he added that he discontinued music as a profession to focus on creating comedy skit contents in the entertainment industry. In his recent chat with Punch, Lasisi said; “Growth has happened over the years. There was a time when we looked up to radio and television.” “Then, social media became the in-thing. Social media has been in existence since the early 2010s but it became more prominent later on. That was how I saw an avenue to express myself.” “The primary objective when I started was not actually to make money. I just saw it as an opportunity for me to be out there (in the public glare). It felt good but I was pursuing a career in music alongside and it was a struggle.” “I felt the best way to become famous, aside from my music, was to create skits. I tried and it paid off eventually. I became popular and I no longer saw the need to pursue a career in music. Hence, I decided to continue creating content and be in the entertainment space.” Being one of the most prominent online skit makers in Nigeria, Lasisi revealed he would explore from TV shows to comedy, movies, and production to stay relevant.
