The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has urged the federal government to scrap the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). According to the Union, it is not in line with the operations of the university system and should be scrapped in the country’s overall interest of tertiary education. The Coordinator of ASUU-Calabar Zone, Aniekan Brown, declared in Calabar, the capital of Cross River State, that ASUU is committed to resistance for the life and preservation of the quality of public university education in Nigeria.
