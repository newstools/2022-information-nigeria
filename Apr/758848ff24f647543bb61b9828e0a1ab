Presidential hopefuls on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) platform from the southeast have asked members of the party from other regions to back a candidate from their region. Former Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim, former governor of Anambra Peter Obi, Sam Ohuabunwa, and Nwachukwu Anakwenze spoke during a press conference in Abuja on Saturday. In the sake of “fairness and equity,” the former Senate president said he and his colleagues will work with party members from other regions to ensure that the PDP presidential ticket is assigned to the south-east. “It is our knowledge that more aspirants may have obtained forms under PDP. We hope that they will join us a little later,” he said.

We will work together to ensure that a south-easterner emerges as the PDP flag bearer for the 2023 presidential election. “We intend to consult with other zones on this issue and it is based on fairness and equity. In doing so, it is important to note that we have always supported other zones, and we now expect them to reciprocate.” Anyim said the party’s constitution supports zoning, adding they will stick to their guns on the matter. “In fact, in line with the PDP constitution, we believe that the PDP constitution favours what we are doing and we have to boldly step out with this decision,” he said.
