Senator Shehu Sani, a former lawmaker, claims that the savage armed men who kidnapped passengers on the Abuja-Kaduna train were ‘jihadist’ terrorists. Recall that on March 27, terrorists ambushed the train on its approach to Kaduna State, killing a number of passengers, injuring dozens, and kidnapping over a hundred. In a recent video, the bandits demanded that the Federal Government respond quickly or the abductees would be killed, claiming that they are not after money. The video, however, reveals that the criminal elements are not just bandits, according to the Kaduna State governorship hopeful in the upcoming general elections in 2023.
