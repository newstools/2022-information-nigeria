Former Jigawa governor Sule Lamido believes the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) “northern consensus presidential candidates” named on Friday do not reflect the views of party members in the region. Four presidential hopefuls — former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Bauchi Governor Bala Mohammed, Sokoto Governor Aminu Tambuwal, and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, former managing director of the now-defunct FSB International Bank — have held consultations across the country on a consensus candidacy in recent weeks. Following the issuance of a report by Ango Abdullahi, elder statesman, Saraki and Bala Mohammed were named “northern consensus candidates” on Friday. Tambuwal, on the other hand, had rejected the report, claiming that it did not reflect the agreement struck at an earlier meeting between the four candidates. In a statement issued on Saturday, Lamido described the report as the “personal opinion” of those who issued it.
