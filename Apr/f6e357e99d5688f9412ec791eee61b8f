 Tacha has pitched her tent with Nigerian singer Davido amidst being snubbed by his colleagues over his FIFA win. Davido made history and made Nigerians proud as he, alongside Trinidad Cardona and AISHA, sang the 2022 World Cup soundtrack titled ‘Hayya Hayya’ (Better Together). Taking to the microblogging platform Twitter, Davido said he is honored with the feat, adding it is a win for Africa. Many fans and music lovers stormed social media platforms jubilating and praising Davido for making Nigerians proud. Since this development and after his performance in Qatar on Friday night, 1st April 2022, many of his colleagues such as Burna Boy, Wizkid, Tiwa Savage, and Don Jazzy have remained mute over it. This has stirred social media reactions, debate and comparison among Nigerian singers. However, in a post shared on Twitter, Tacha opined that Davido deserves his flowers because he has queued his way tirelessly to the top. According to Tacha, everything Davido is doing is for Africa. She added that the representation is extensive, and people should stop playing as Davido is the actual GOAT (Greatest of All of Time) in the music industry.
