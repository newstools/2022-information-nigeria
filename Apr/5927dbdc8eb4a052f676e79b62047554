The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has stated that it is yet to fix a date for the National Executive Committee (NEC) to deliberate on the issue of zoning for the 2023 presidential ticket. On March 24, the party set up a 37-member zoning committee, led by Samuel Ortom, Benue governor, to decide on whether or not to adopt zoning. The panel has its recommendation to the national executive council (NEC) of the party for further action.
