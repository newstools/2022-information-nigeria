The Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) have threatened a total and indefinite strike in the country’s education sector. The NASU and SSANU Joint Action Committee (JAC) stated this in a statement on Wednesday, amid the unions’ ongoing warning strike. They argued that the decision was essential since the administration had failed to address the concerns that had prompted the warning strike. “We had written no less than 10 letters or reminders to the government to no avail, not even an acknowledgement,” the communique read.

Shamefully and painfully, there was no attempt by the Government to intercept or even invite the Unions to a meeting. “This aloof and contemptuous attitude of Government further incensed our members who resolved that following the failure of Government to even invite the leaderships for a meeting, the strike should be extended by another two weeks before an indefinite and total strike is declared. “As of today, the two weeks extension is getting to the middle and with no response insight from the government, we may be left with no resort but to embark on an indefinite and total strike. This is gradually becoming unavoidable and inevitable.”
