Bala Mohammed, the governor of Bauchi and a presidential hopeful for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has fired a salvo at the All Progressives Congress (APC). Mohammed said the ruling party has ruined everything while speaking at a dinner sponsored by former ministers appointed by successive PDP regimes on Tuesday night. According to Mohammed, Buhari’s government is “nepotistic,” and if he is elected president, he will lead an inclusive administration.

Why is the country so divided? We must reduce the acrimony. APC has destroyed everything. It is all nepotism,” he said. “We are detribalised as democrats. We cannot be a regionalized government.” Mohammed stated that there is the need to reduce the country’s borrowing which has risen under the Buhari administration. “You will help make Nigeria great again by collaborating together in this effort,” he said.“We shall not take APC for granted. They are planning all sorts of intimidations but we are steadfast.”
