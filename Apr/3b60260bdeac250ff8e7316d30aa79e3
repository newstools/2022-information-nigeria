 Apparently, the ‘wedding’ between popular Instagram skit makers, Debo Adedayo, fondly known as Mr Macaroni, and Kemi Ikuseedun, also known as Mummy Wa, is a hoax. According to sources who spoke to newsmen, the wedding was just make- One of the sources close to Mr Macaroni, via the telephone, stated that they used the gimmick to draw traffic to their pages, as well as that of the vendors that were tagged in the post. “They are not married o. It was a sort of collaboration between them and some of the vendors that they tagged,” the source said. Also, after much probing, one of the vendors also spilled the beans, saying that the supposed wedding was just make-believe. The vendor simply said, “It is a celebrity make-belief shoot. It’s not real.” The pair who have become popular on the social media space, especially on Instagram through their skits, got tongues wagging over the weekend when they posted pictures of themselves in what seemed to be their traditional wedding photos. Moreso, Mr Macaroni, via his verified Instagram page, posted a series of pictures and wrote, “Engagement Today, Wedding Tomorrow.” Similarly, Kemi took to her verified Instagram page, @Kemz_mama, and posted a short wedding clip with the watermark “Kemi Ikuseedun + Debo Adebayo.” In the caption section, she wrote, “DaddyWa finally paid mummy wa’s bride price @mrmacaroni + @kemz_mama.”
