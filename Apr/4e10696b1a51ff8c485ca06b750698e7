The governor expressed his condolences to the Oyo State Traditional Council, the Oyomesi, Oba Adeyemi’s immediate family, the people of Oyo Kingdom, and the entire Yoruba race, saying Alaafin’s words of advice and guidance were always golden and helpful. He also prayed to God to grant repose to the departed monarch’s soul. He claimed that Oyo State had lost a royal institution and an authority, which Alaafin had become as a result of his high-octane mastery of Yoruba history, politics, and national development.
